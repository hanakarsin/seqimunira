Like when Barstool founder Dave Portnoy donned a disguise and crashed the 2018 Super Bowl media day and called Ram defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh the "dirtiest player in the NFL" and warned him not to hurt Tom Brady. It's easy to know why David did this: He's an avowed Patriots fan.</p><p>But why are fans counting whenever the Bucks' <a href=#>Giannis Antetokounmpo</a> is playing?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Why do fans count when Giannis is playing?</h2><p>It has to do with the sweet time the NBA standout takes whenever he's fouled and stakes shots from the free throw line. Giannis is one of the top talents in the league; the Greek Freak was league MVP two years in a row. Many attribute his success on the court to an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"old-school mentality"</a> in that he practices hard and isn't necessarily buddy-buddy with opposing team members.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: YouTube</span></figure><p>The Phoenix Suns were set as early favorites to win the NBA Finals, with the Arizona-based group of ballers headed by Chris Paul taking an early lead of two games to one.</p><p>However Giannis and the Bucks were able to rally and win three games in a row, with the ultimate prize in their grasps at the end of the season.</p><p>But that doesn't mean people aren't roasting Antetokounmpo for the inordinate amount of time it takes when he shoots a free throw.</p><p>Players have also rolled their eyes on the court at how long Giannis takes at the line. This includes James Harden, who threw his arms up in defeat at the player as he took practice "form shots" while waiting on the line for a free throw. Take a look at the clip below, which also includes Brooklyn Nets fans lampooning Giannis with their counting.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>James Harden bout to watch a “bagless” Giannis get a ring before him . 😂😂😂 🗣 BUCKS IN 6 !! <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/nQcT52QlYt</a></p>— Kel’s Burner 😂 (@ThatsBooby) <a href=#>July 18, 2021</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">When was the last time the Milwaukee Bucks won an NBA championship?</h2><p>... in 1971, meaning that it's been a long time coming for Milwaukee basketball fans.

Kevin Durant put on several masterful performances. But with James Harden operating in a limited capacity, and seasonal injuries impeding the Nets' chance to properly "flow" with one another, many think the 2021–2022 season is ripe for the Nets to take after all of these issues are sorted out, given their deep talent pool.</p><p>But now we have to wait and see what the outcome of the NBA finals between the Suns and Bucks will be.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOoZJ%2BZnqh6pLvUp6tmr5iau26zyJqlp6GjYra0ec%2BlmLKhnpw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./1420802-alex-smiths-wife-elizabeth-barry-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Alex Smiths wife: what do we know about Elizabeth Barry?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./32-surreal-places-that-actually-exist-on-earth-i-cant-believe-this-isnt-photoshopped.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Most Instagrammed Tourist Destinations in the World</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brooke-shields-html.html>Brooke Shields - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-murray-die-in-stranger-things-4.html>Does Murray Die at the End of 'Stranger Things' Season 4?
