The circumstances surrounding the young woman's death are very suspicious and have led to many theories online.</p><p>Here's what we know about Miller's passing, and whether her husband, John Paul Miller, was involved — as well as <a href=#>what happened leading up to her death</a>, and what her family members are saying in court documents.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Facebook</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">So, what happened to Mica Miller?</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ABC 15 News</a>, Miller's death has been ruled a suicide.</p><p style=text-align:start>Robeson County Medical Examiner Dr. Richard Johnson confirmed that Miller's passing was the result of a self-inflicted gunshot wound sustained on April 27, 2024, at Lumber River State Park.</p><p>Johnson said, “Based on the nature of the wound, that it is consistent with a self-inflicted gunshot wound. And it was not in the back of the head, as it has been speculated.”</p><p style=text-align:start>Sheriff Burnis Wilkins meanwhile has asked "for everyone to please await the full timeline of events before making assumptions and coming to conclusions."</p><p>Of course, assumptions have been running rampant since Miller was in the process of divorcing her husband. Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">court records</a>, she originally filed for divorce in October 2023, but it was dismissed. Two requests for separate support and maintenance were also made — one in March and one in April 2024.</p><p>Miller also shared eyebrow-raising concerns with her family members about the state of their relationship.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p>We would like to extend an invitation to all who know and love our beautiful sister Mica.

Per an affidavit filed by her sister Sierra Francis, Miller said if anything happened to her, her husband was responsible, per the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Post</a>.</p><p style=text-align:start>Per her sister, Miller's husband abused her and harassed her in the weeks leading up to her death.</p><p style=text-align:start>“My sister also expressed to me that she was fearful that she would not make it to the divorce and that her life would be taken from her. It is my belief, based on conversations with my sister, that she told multiple people, including other family members,” Francis said, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Christian Post</a>.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Facebook</a></figure><p>Meanwhile, Nathaniel Francis, her brother, said in a separate affidavit that Miller found a tracking device on her car and her were tires slashed on multiple occasions.

I took care of her every time she stopped taking her lithium. I would never expose this stuff of her if I didn't have to now, but every time she tried to kill herself, I would be there. I would literally sometimes pick her up physically, put her in the truck, take her to the [hospital],” he told The Christian Post.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p>When terrible terrible TERRIBLE things happen to you… (yall know what I’m talking about;) RPF: resting peace face #stillblessed #Godisgood</p>Posted by <a href=#>Mica Miller</a> on&nbsp;<a href=#>Tuesday, April 9, 2024</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Mica Miller shared a cryptic last social media post.</h2><p>While clearly there is more that will unfold with this story — Miller's family has asked for a full investigation into her death — her own last words are chilling.</p><p>Taking to Facebook just weeks before her passing, Miller wrote, “When terrible terrible TERRIBLE things happen to you… (y'all know what I’m talking about;) RPF: resting peace face.”</p><p><strong>If you or someone you know is experiencing domestic violence, call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-7233.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGSmoZOWeq61y6Wcqw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./is-lea-pregnant-on-the-good-doctor.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>'The Good Doctor' Season 6 May Be About to Reveal Lea's Pregnancy Here's Why</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./i-feel-your-unbearable-pain-cry-of-hunger-atiku-tells-nigerian-workers.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>I Feel Your Unbearable Pain, Cry Of Hunger</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brooke-shields-html.html>Brooke Shields - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-murray-die-in-stranger-things-4.html>Does Murray Die at the End of 'Stranger Things' Season 4?
