I am very angry. I am angry because I spent two days in Enugu and nothing happened to me but it is in my own state that the convoy released to me by the governor of Enugu state (a very good man) to attend the burial ceremony of Ihedioha’s mother at Mbaise that was attacked and one policeman killed.</p><p>“What is happening in Imo state makes me angry. Many people who are running to govern Imo state are not capable but I have seen one man who the cap fits. When it is time I will speak.”</p><p>Also, one of Okorocha’s aides told Punch on condition of anonymity that the vehicles in the convoy, which comprised a Sports Utility Vehicle, a bus, and Hilux were shattered by bullets during the attack.</p><p>He said two other security agents we kidnapped by the attackers but were released the same day.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH13e5BxZqijn6e8pLTAZqquqqaew6a%2FjJqqrJmjqLavrdOipqdlkanBprnPrWSpp5yesKZ5zp%2BdopuVp3qstculnJ1n</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./does-meredith-die-on-b-positive.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What Happens to Meredith on 'B Positive'?
