Or Jimmy Buffett fans and Acapulco shirts. Or Jimmy Buffett fans and anything Margaritaville.</p><p>The easy-living, beach-loving lifestyle has a certain appeal to retirees who've put up with their fair amount of crap in life and just want to take it easy, and it only makes sense that they'd be obsessed with Jimmy Buffett, as he's pretty much the patron saint of piña colada songs that are actually about cheating on your spouse but discovering they were trying to cheat on you too, so it's all just big HA-HA good time.</p><p>And in what happens to be the most brilliant business move I've seen in a very long time, Jimmy Buffett has announced that he's going to open a line of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Margaritaville-inspired retirement</a> homes so party-loving senior citizens can play out the rest of their golden years literally living in a Jimmy Buffett song.</p><p>The homes are called Latitude Margaritaville and the first crop of retirement communities will be based in — where else? Florida.&nbsp;</p><p>So far, Buffett and Co. have Daytona Beach, Hilton Head, and Watersound locations on deck, and the communities' website is packed with stunning images that'll have you counting down the days till you can cash out your pension and relax on a beach, waiting to die with a drink in your hand, a smile on your face, and beautiful scenery to soak in.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: latitude margaritaville</a></figure><p>The pitch on the community's website sure sounds enticing, and it's pretty much all the coercion any Buffett-Head will need to immediately sign on the dotted line.</p>"It’s always been that happy place in your mind, the spirit of adventure in your soul. It’s the state of mind when it all comes together in one of life’s perfect moments. When your mind wanders to this paradise, why not follow it home?"<figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: latitude margaritaville</a></figure><p>And judging by the photos and renderings of this retirement community, it definitely looks like the kind of place that self-proclaimed "Parrotheads" would love to kick back and relax in.</p><p>This particular location isn't situated on a beachfront, but it's been set up so that nearly every home in it has a view of blue water. Pretty magical.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: latitude margaritaville</a></figure><p>The sales center is a good indication of what these units are going to look like inside.</p><p>Seriously, just by looking at these pictures you're going to feel like the Buff-Man himself came and punched you in the face while handing you a piña colada.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: latitude margaritaville</a></figure><p>I mean, it just doesn't get any more Jimmy Buffett-ey than this. You can almost hear the oxygen masks and quiet murmurs of "this is real music" while looking at these photos.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: latitude margaritaville</a></figure><p>The same aesthetic carries into the individual units that boast island-getaway-themed names like Jamaica, Antigua, Barbuda, Nevis, Coconut, Parrot, Breeze, Aruba and Trinidad. The Jamaica home pictured below also packs a swimming pool and hot tub inside a sunroom, in case you want to soak up some rays off the sand.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: latitude margaritaville</span></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: latitude margaritaville</span></figure><p>Now, I haven't found anything that confirms this in the literature, but judging from the promo photos, it appears that every single room comes complete with a margarita that magically spawns out of nowhere. Pretty sick.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: latitude margaritaville</span></figure><p>What's even crazier is that each development will get occasional performances from Jimmy himself on the community's band stage. They've seriously thought of everything.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: latitude margaritaville</span></figure><p>And although the concept of Latitude Margaritaville sounds like the premise for an epic comedy sketch, it's just another instance of great ideas from the king of laid-back tropical-themed chill music.</p><p>The fact that Escape to Margaritaville was made into a Broadway musical is yet another genius business move.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: playbill</span></figure><p>Think about it: You're an older-than-middle-aged couple with some disposable income and you want something to do on your date night. Maybe you live in Northern New Jersey. You want to go see a Broadway musical, but your kids have made you sick of everything Disney by the time you hit 40, so that's out of the question. That's when you actually take your neighbor Tina's advice for once, and remember how she gushed about the amazing time she had watching the Jimmy Buffett musical with Francis last weekend.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: getty</span></figure><p>Buffett's laid-back way of life is also an official school of thought. No, literally, there's a Margaritaville University.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: margaritaville university</span></figure><p>Technically, it's just an excuse to get a bunch of students to party, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">but the website</a> shows that it's pretty serious about getting the "Margaritaville" mindset into as many college campuses as possible.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: margaritaville university</span></figure><p>Buffett's become so successful on selling people 'the idea of Jimmy Buffett' that he inevitably hasn't lived the lifestyle he preaches for a while. A fact that the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Times</a> pointed out in this piece on the singer.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: getty</span></figure><p>If you feel like living the Margaritaville-lifestyle without enrolling in school or buying a place in a senior home, and Jimmy Buffett concerts aren't enough for you, you could, of course, always book a few nights in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Margaritaville resort</a>.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: margaritaville</span></figure><p>Locations are opening everywhere, and not just on sunny beaches. There's one coming to NYC, which will be interesting to see, to say the least.</p><p>Buffett's turned the beach bum lifestyle into a profitable business, and it's not difficult to see why that wasn't hard: Who doesn't want to day-drink on a beach whenever they feel like it and shirk their uncomfortable daily responsibilities?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">More from Distractify</h2><p><a href=#>11 Canned Cocktails To Throw In Your Beach Bag This Summer</a></p><p><a href=#>The Reviews For This 12-Foot Beach Ball Are As Hilarious As You Expect</a></p><p><a href=#>These Ingenious Floating Wheelchairs Make The Beach Accessible For Everyone&nbsp;</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKyimrultc2gZmtoYW18cYOOa2tokmSEjo6cjqOgpqWpYq%2B2ssWeq61lnZa%2FqK3RoquarpmhuaZ50Z6roqqVorKvwA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./nina-agdal-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Nina Agdal - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./260247-wahubiri-watofautiana-kuhusu-wito-wa-papa-francis-wa-kurekebisha-sala-ya-bwa-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Wahubiri watofautiana kuhusu wito wa Papa Francis wa kurekebisha Sala ya Bwana</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brooke-shields-html.html>Brooke Shields - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-murray-die-in-stranger-things-4.html>Does Murray Die at the End of 'Stranger Things' Season 4?
