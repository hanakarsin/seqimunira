His steely blue eyes watch the hands of every baker as they deftly and/or awkwardly knead whatever bread concoction they are tasked with creating.</p><p>During Collection 10, two bakers were mysteriously absent from Bread Week and fans wondered if they just couldn't cut it. What happened to Rebs and Abdul?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">What happened to Rebs and Abdul on 'GBBO'?</h2><p>At the start of Episode 3, host <a href=#>Matt Lucas</a> announced that "both Rebs and Abdul are a bit under the weather this week," and therefore would not be participating in the dreaded Bread Week. The official Twitter account for The Great British Bake Off <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">confirmed this in a tweet</a> adding that they hoped Rebs and Abdul would be "back in the Bake Off Tent next week."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix (video still)</span><p>https://www.distractify.com/p/smothered-cast-instagrams</p></figure><p>The tweet replies varied from reluctant acceptance to downright nasty. "If you can't compete for any reason you should be eliminated. It's not fair at all," wrote <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter user Pyeinthesky</a>. Rebs <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">took to Twitter</a> in order to respond to the accusations that she wasn't sick but rather faking it to get out of the curse that is Bread Week.</p><p>"Will say it once for the people in the back, I DID NOT want to miss bread week (it was probably my strongest week)." said Rebs. "I was forced to go home for the safety of all in the tent. I just wanted the world to see my Lahmacun <a href=#>pizza</a> and Mexican style smorgastarta." She also <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted a photo of herself</a> leaving the tent in a taxi with the caption, "Camilla Cabello said ain't no crying in the club, but she never said anything about not crying in the taxi cause you're missing your best baking week."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>My friend just sent me this screenshot she took from me leaving the tent with illness ðŸ˜‚ <a href=#>#GBBO</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/npUAK2GTJP</a></p>â€” Rebs Lightbody (@rebsbakes) <a href=#>September 27, 2022</a> <span>Source: Twitter/@rebsbakes</span></figure><p>Abdul is less vocal on social media, with only <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">two posts on his Instagram</a> which currently has 939 followers. Hey, we aren't judging. It's hard out there in those social media streets! As of the time of this writing, his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">most recent post was a video shot</a> by fellow contestant Kevin Flynn. In the video, Kevin is remarking on the fact that Abdul was last in the technical while Abdul pretends to wipe away a tear. "Cracking up all over again. Miss our family dinners," commented Rebs.</p><p>Let's hope this camaraderie remains for the rest of the show!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnK%2Bju4yrnJurXZa7pXnAm5uupF2staLAjKGYqaiVo7Kl</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ainsley-weber-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ainsley Weber - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kkw-beauty-new-name.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>Kim Kardashian Will Be Shutting Down KKW Beauty to Create a New Brand Identity</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brooke-shields-html.html>Brooke Shields - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-murray-die-in-stranger-things-4.html>Does Murray Die at the End of 'Stranger Things' Season 4?
