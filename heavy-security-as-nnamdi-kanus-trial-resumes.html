Our law is that, notwithstanding the procedure, it is still a valid evidence before the court.</p><p>“If the police arrest a defendant, torture them, and illegally obtain evidence, does it divest the trial court of its jurisdiction?” the court queried.</p><p>It held that the remedy open for Kanu was for him to institute a civil proceeding against FG.</p><p>“That is the position of the Nigerian law,” the apex court held, adding that the judgement of the appellate court, though noble, “still remains within the realm of sentiment.”</p><p>Insisting that judgement in such a case must be based on express legislation, the Supreme Court said it found no reason to align itself with the appellate court’s position.</p><p>“There is no legislation in Nigeria that says the trial court will no longer have jurisdiction where prosecution does anything illegal against a person standing trial.</p><p>“If prosecution destroys someone’s home in search of evidence, that will not stop the trial, but will raise a cause of action.</p><p>“We decline to go with the Court of Appeal, in as much as we strongly condemn what the prosecution did.</p><p>“Nigeria must be concerned about its image, both locally and internationally. If a person is standing trial, why must you invade his home? That is totally irresponsible,” the apex court added.</p><p>It held that FG ought to have approached the trial court if it felt that Nnamdi Kanu breached his bail conditions.</p><p>Besides, it held that the high court acted wrongly when it revoked the initial bail it granted to Kanu, saying the action was “totally unfair” since he took a flight to save his life.</p><p>“Nigeria barely recovered from the case of Umaru Dikko, and we should not repeat it,” the apex court warned as it upheld FG’s appeal marked: SC/CR/1361/2022 and dismissed Kanu’s Cross-Appeal marked: SC/CR/394/2022.</p><p>It ordered Nnmadi Kanu to go back and defend himself on the seven-count charge that is pending against him.</p><p>Kanu reportedly sacked his legal team after the judgement.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ze5FvZqGdkavGbr%2FEnKyroaSueqK%2FjKelmqWUnnqsrc2uqmasop6urXnRnqqupZWofA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-to-vote-americas-favorite-houseguest.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How to Vote for America's Favorite Houseguest on Big Brother</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./michele-poulik-ncis-la.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Michele Poulik From 'NCIS LA:' the Show Commemorates the Set Decorator</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brooke-shields-html.html>Brooke Shields - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-murray-die-in-stranger-things-4.html>Does Murray Die at the End of 'Stranger Things' Season 4?
