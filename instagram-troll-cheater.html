I can't count the number of <a href=#>creepazoids my wife rolls her eyes out and grunts "ugh"</a> to as she deletes message requests on her personal Instagram account. Her page is filled with pictures of us as a family, but some dudes just can't take the hint.</p><p>Like this one guy who thought he'd message 21-year-old Amy Perkins and ask her out for a drink. She declined, explaining that she was about to get married to her boyfriend. The dude's response to that was a bit infuriating.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: istock</span></figure><p>He "jokingly" offers to marry her, should she and her significant other ever break up. Now I don't know about you, but even if you secretly hope someone breaks up with their S/O, you don't say that to somebody.</p><p>Clearly they're in a relationship for a reason, and you'd have to be a pretty big dirtbag to wish that their upcoming marriage would break down. Something that both Amy and her fiancé, Ashley, were struck by.</p><p>But rather than just getting mad, the two of them decided to get even — and teach this thirsty dude a thing or two about sliding into the DMs of someone who is spoken for.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: imgur</a></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: imgur</a></figure><p>Now you might be thinking to yourself, "OK, but how is Amy giving this dude a booty shot teaching him anything?" Yes, that would be confusing. It was even confusing to the guy who messaged her.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: imgur</span></figure><p>Although he seem a little nonplussed by the provocative photo, he persisted, seemingly un-phased that his offer of some "action" would potentially break up a marriage.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: imgur</a></figure><p>However, he was quick to learn that the booty he was admiring didn't belong to Amy at all, but her fiancé, Ashley. Who was more than happy to send the dude a picture of the person whose behind he was really admiring.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: imgur</a></figure><p>Quicker than you can say, "die f-boy," the thirsty dude ended up noping out of the situation and blocking Amy's Instagram account immediately. Guess he doesn't like being tricked into finding men's bodies attractive, oh well.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Metro</a>, Amy and Ashley talked about the&nbsp;whole hilarious situation and the inordinate amount of compliments Ashley's been receiving on his backside.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: imgur</a></figure><p>Amy says that she wasn't surprised that the thirsty dude who reached out to her was fooled into drooling over her fiancé's butt — she thinks it's a "lovely bottom." And there are plenty of people who agree.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: imgur</a></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: imgur</a></figure><p>But there are some other commenters who weren't so forgiving of the original messager's oversights — they couldn't believe they didn't notice Ashley's other manly attributes.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: imgur</a></figure><p>Or that he took the prank very seriously. If anyone has a problem with a dude shaving his butt for a joke, then I'd like to have a word with them. Because if you're going to troll someone, especially a rando who's hitting on your S/O, you have to go all the way.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: imgur</span></figure><p>But people started noticing other things about the photo as well. Like the "emergency" can of Pringles in the background of Ashley's big reveal. Were they planted there? Did they know the guy loved non-greasy, intact potato chips and that would distract from Amy's boo's "manly" forearms?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: imgur</a></figure><p>Some, however, had a problem with Amy signing off with "xx" on her messages and say that she was sending the dude "mixed messages." But I think she made it pretty clear that she wasn't interested at all. Plus "xx" is one of those force-of-habit things. How many times have you typed "lol" and you weren't laughing out loud? Be honest.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: imgur</a></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKCloryze5FpaHFnYG18coOOa2x%2Bo2N3fKq60q2YoKqRonq1vs6lo2abmJqutbHR</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./march17-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>March 17 Birthdays | Famous Birthdays</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./february12-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>February 12 Deaths | Famous Birthdays</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brooke-shields-html.html>Brooke Shields - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-murray-die-in-stranger-things-4.html>Does Murray Die at the End of 'Stranger Things' Season 4?
