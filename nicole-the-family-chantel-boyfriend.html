Pedro's meddling sister, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nicole Jimeno</a>, is back — but this time, she has a new boyfriend.&nbsp;</p><p>Who is Nicole's boyfriend, Alejandro? Keep reading to find out more about her relationship, and to learn what else will be featured on Season 2.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TLC</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Who is Nicole Jimeno's boyfriend?</h2><p>While the relationship status between Pedro and Chantel has stayed steady in between Seasons 1 and 2 of The Family Chantel, some things have changed. Pedro's sister Nicole, who lives in the Dominican Republic, embarks on a relationship with a man named Alejandro Padron in Season 2.&nbsp;</p><p>Though Alejandro is also originally from the Dominican Republic too, he now lives in New York. The 27-year-old is involved in the perfume business, according to his Instagram bio (his page is set to private). Alejandro lists his job as the CEO of Perfumeria AEPS.</p><p>When filming for the second season commenced, Nicole noted that the two had been together for a few months already.&nbsp;</p><p>It's unclear if the two are still together now, but they will weather a few storms together on The Family Chantel.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Nicole's family doesn't approve of her relationship with Alejandro.</h2><p>Despite the physical distance between them, Nicole and Alejandro have forged a relationship — but it won't stop Nicole's family from attempting to intercede.&nbsp;</p><p>In the trailer for Season 2, Pedro and Chantel (who live in Atlanta) will meet Alejandro to find out if he is genuine in his feelings for Nicole.&nbsp;</p><p>Viewers will have to tune in to the show to find out exactly what is said, but the trailer teased that things will not go well.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"></figure><p>"You're a liar and you're full of lies. You really like hiding things," Pedro tells his sister in a Facetime call on the show after sitting down with Alejandro.</p><p>Pedro won't be the only Jimeno who disapproves of Nicole's boyfriend.&nbsp;The trailer also showed that Alejandro will ultimately return to the Dominican Republic to meet the rest of Nicole's family.&nbsp;</p><p>"I am just going to go by the flow," he explains to the cameras, but Nicole's loved ones have other things in mind.</p><p>They do not hold back when it comes to expressing their dissatisfaction toward him.</p><p>"He's not the man for you," her mom, Lidia Jimeno, says in front of Alejandro. &nbsp;</p><p>"But I am in love with him!" Nicole exclaims to her mom.&nbsp;</p><p>Lidia then rolls Alejandro's suitcase out of her home, and she breaks a bottle of his perfume on the way out. Is it a sign of what is to come between Nicole and Alejandro? You'll have to watch the show to find out.&nbsp;</p><p>The Family Chantel airs on Mondays at 9 p.m. on TLC.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfo7aku8ueZK2glWKzornIpbBmm5iWu7Wxy2aZqLGWp7amusM%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./462245-nigerians-await-decisive-actions-from-president-buhari-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Nigerians Await Decisive Actions From President Buhari</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jonathan-toews-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jonathan Toews - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brooke-shields-html.html>Brooke Shields - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-murray-die-in-stranger-things-4.html>Does Murray Die at the End of 'Stranger Things' Season 4?
