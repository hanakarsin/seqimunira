The news of Van Houten's release comes decades after she received multiple sentences for the murders of supermarket executive Leno LaBianca and his wife, Rosemary, at their Los Angeles home. Many people want to learn more about the infamous woman.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Van Houten, who is currently in her 70s, was just 19 when she first met Charles Manson and began to carry out murders on his behalf. Now, some want to better understand her surprisingly large net worth. Keep reading for all of the details.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is Leslie Van Houten's net worth?</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Van Houten's net worth comes in large part from her notoriety, and the role she played in the killings that have now become the only thing most people know about her. Estimates for her net worth range from $1 million to $15 million, but it's unclear whether that net worth is based on how much money she actually has or how much her earnings could be if she signs a book deal or does other work to reclaim her notoriety.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p class="sc-eEVlDD iAFcKh"><span>Leslie Van Houten</span></p><p class="sc-jlZIZy iWVnnf">Convicted murderer</p><p><strong>Net worth:</strong> $15 Million</p><p>Leslie Van Houten is a former member of the Manson family who was convicted of murdering supermarket executive Leno LaBianca and his wife, Rosemary, at their Los Angeles home in 1971. She has been serving concurrent sentences for these murders. She was released from prison in 2023 for a three-year probationary period.</p><p><strong>Birthdate:</strong> Aug. 23, 1949</p><p><strong>Birthplace:</strong> Los Angeles</p><p><strong>Parents:</strong> Paul and Jane Van Houten</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How did Leslie Van Houten get rich?</h2><p>Any money that Van Houten has likely comes from her notoriety, and from book deals and other opportunities over the years. The money is a direct result of who she is, and has little to do with any money that she or her parents had prior to the murders.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why was Leslie Van Houten released from prison?</h2><p>A state appellate court ruled in May 2023 that Van Houten could be made eligible for parole, which ultimately opened up the possibility of her being paroled.</p><p>California Governor Gavin Newsom announced that he wouldn't challenge the court's decision, which sparked outrage among those who are still angry about the murders Van Houten committed decades ago.</p><p>“More than 50 years after the Manson cult committed these brutal offenses, the victims’ families still feel the impact, as do all Californians. Governor Newsom reversed Ms. Van Houten’s parole grant three times since taking office and defended against her challenges of those decisions in court,” a spokesperson for the governor said following the news.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>“The Governor is disappointed by the Court of Appeal’s decision to release Ms. Van Houten but will not pursue further action as efforts to further appeal are unlikely to succeed. The California Supreme Court accepts appeals in very few cases, and generally does not select cases based on this type of fact-specific determination,” the statement continued.</p><p>Van Houten has been in custody for 53 years, and will reportedly participate in a transitionary housing program that will help her learn how to support herself and live a productive life. She was initially sentenced to death following her trial, but California abolished the death penalty in the 1970s, and her sentence was commuted to life in prison.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfobK0uMieZK%2BZnmK1sMHTnqVmppWperi70a2f</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./363251-9-enticing-photos-mexican-soap-opera-queen-anna-brenda-aka-alehandra-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>9 enticing photos of Mexican soap opera queen Anna Brenda aka Alehandra</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./harrysong.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Read All The Latest News About Harrysong On Naija News</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brooke-shields-html.html>Brooke Shields - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-murray-die-in-stranger-things-4.html>Does Murray Die at the End of 'Stranger Things' Season 4?
