During the 1920's in Japan, there was a famed pupper named Hachiko who would visit the rail station every day to wait for his owner, agricultural scientist and professor, Hidesabur≈ç Ueno, to return home from work.</p><p>When Ueno owner died, however, the dog was left without its beloved master. But that didn't stop him from going to the train station every day for the next 9 years, many believing in the hope that he would return.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: pinterest</a></figure><p>Hachiko's undying devotion became a story of national interest in Japan. He became a celebrity, like Xiongxiong, with people coming to visit him and spend some time with the dog who refused to leave the station he made his home.</p><p>The Shiba Inu ended up becoming a symbol of loyalty and dedication to one's family for the entire country. When he passed away, a proper funeral was held in his honor - such was the respect he received for the love he displayed for Master Ueno.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: wikimedia</a></figure><p>Statues were erected in his honor, celebrating the dog's life and commitment to his beloved human. Hachiko's inspired several books, movies, stories, and tons of references to the good boy can be found in countless stories.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: wikimedia</a></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: wikimedia</span></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: wikimedia</span></figure><p>He was ultimately buried beside Ueno in Aoyama cemetery, Tokyo so the two could be reunited at last.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: wikimedia</span></figure><p>Now I don't want to get all choked up thinking about it, but Xiongxiong is kinda getting up there in age is already past the average lifespan of a dog. Let's hope whenever this good boy goes he gets a proper send off like Hachiko did.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaJmenrqiuNJoaWlpaGR9dnuPbWadn3tuxXCwzqBkrK2SrK66edGeq66qng%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./1322991-bam-margera-bio-age-net-worth-wife-house-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>¬´&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Bam Margera bio: age, net worth, wife, house, where is he now?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ukraine-russia-war.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;¬ª</span><p class=pager__title>Read All The Latest News About Russia Ukraine War On Naija News</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brooke-shields-html.html>Brooke Shields - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-murray-die-in-stranger-things-4.html>Does Murray Die at the End of 'Stranger Things' Season 4?
