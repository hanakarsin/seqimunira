Ghana qualified ahead of Nigeria thanks to an away goal rule following the 1-1 draw in Abuja.</p><p>The two West African rivals will meet in Marrakech, Morocco, at 5 p.m. on Friday, March 22, in an international friendly.</p><p>“They call it friendly matches but there is really nothing friendly when you play, especially Ghana. I have been involved in matches against Ghana since the 1992 Africa Cup of Nations in Senegal”, Finidi told NFF Media.</p><p>“Matches between our countries are serious duels and always seen as battles by our peoples. The Black Stars did not perform that well at the recent Africa Cup of Nations and they will be keen to banish that memory.”</p><p>Aside from aiming to beat Ghana for the pride of the country and the fans of the Super Eagles, Finidi George is hoping for a positive performance from the team to build their confidence going into the 2026 World Cup qualifiers.</p><p>Aside from meeting Ghana, the Super Eagles will meet Mali on March 26, and Finidi George is expecting “good results” from the two games.</p><p>“We finished in second place at the Africa Cup of Nations and everyone expects us to maintain that high rating and be even better in a short while. Our objective is to get good results in these two matches and stay positive ahead of the World Cup qualifiers”, he said.</p><p>“We will be missing four players who have pulled out due to injury but I have confidence in the team that we have here, that they will wear the green-white-green with pride and with patriotic fervour.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH10e5FqZp%2Bhnp6xqnnGnqarn5VisbCx0qerZquVmnq0wc%2BeqWadkZy5pr%2BMqJ1mppmcsrO1wGatrGWXna6vrYyco5qrmGKutHnFq6CeppShxnA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tord-larsson-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Tord Larsson - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./appeal-court-speaks-on-transfering-judges-who-discharged-nnamdi-kanu-of-terrorism-charges.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Appeal Court Speaks On Transfering Judges Who Discharged Nnamdi Kanu Of Terrorism Charges</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brooke-shields-html.html>Brooke Shields - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-murray-die-in-stranger-things-4.html>Does Murray Die at the End of 'Stranger Things' Season 4?
