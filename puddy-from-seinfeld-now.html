What's Patrick up to now?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: NBC</span></figure><p>Few shows have cemented their legacy in television history, continuing to garner a new fanbase well after the series has gone off the air — but <a href=#>Seinfeld</a> is one of those shows. The iconic series, which has been dubbed "the show about nothing," follows four single friends as they navigate life in New York City.</p><p>While the "core four" of the series certainly kept fans laughing (Larry David and a crack writing team helped too), the supporting cast of characters in every episode were brilliant as well. And, one in particular certainly made a lasting impression amongst Seinfeld fans: Puddy.</p><p>Patrick Warburton plays the on-again, off-again boyfriend of Elaine Benes in the hit '90s series. Distractify spoke exclusively with the actor, who partnered with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Days Inn — where he voices a Complimentary Pillow —</a> about the show's lasting legacy, and if the iconic comedy series would resonate with audiences in 2022.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Patrick Warburton aka Puddy from 'Seinfeld' talks about the show's legacy and if it would be popular today.</h2><p>In our discussion with Patrick, he displayed a tremendous amount of poise and grace, a far cry from the fan-favorite recurring character of Puddy. When asked whether or not he thought the show would be as popular today as it was in the '90s, he responded with a resounding "Absolutely. I think that the only thing that would have to be changed ... it would just be updated. [But] the characters absolutely. They'd [just] be dealing with different things."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: NBC</span><p>Puddy from Seinfeld</p></figure><p>He went on to say that "their personalities, their reactions, their vapidness" would all make for compelling TV today, just in a more updated, modern setting. As for his beloved character, the Seinfeld star said it was a blast to play him.</p><p>Seeing clips of him in the show, viewers will notice there's a depth to just how far Patrick takes Puddy's ... not buffoonery, but extreme interest in shallow things. There's a deadpan, simplistic nature to his character that Patrick commits to entirely, and it's a joy to watch.</p><p>Patrick also spoke about another Seinfeld project that has become increasingly meme-worthy over the years: Bee Movie. Fans of the film have stated that his character is the only "sane" one in the film.</p><p>When asked if that "everyone-else-is-nuts" attitude came into playing the character, he said that when he first read the script, he "looked at that as a whole," and that playing the character was "fun because he's so insecure [and] he loses ... to a bee."</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">'Seinfeld' actor Patrick Warburton talks about how being a parent plays into his work.</h2><p>When asked how he feels becoming a dad has affected his work, or not, Patrick quipped about some humbling at-home experiences with his children. While outside the house he's an accomplished actor tackling on-set work in high-profile projects with acclaimed creatives, his kids nonetheless give deadpan stares when he rattles off dad jokes.</p><p>Patrick added that "none of us want to be that stereotypical dad," but he's luxuriated into dad-hood with a "dad band" that covers Pearl Jam tracks. Through this hobby, however, he ended up discovering that the lead singer for Burn the Ballroom was a huge fan of The Venture Bros. (Patrick voices Brock Samson in the series) which led to the actor getting a feature vocal on their track <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"Goddess of the Rain."</a> The song currently has more than a million streams on Spotify.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>Patrick's upcoming projects, like most of his career, couldn't be billed any more differently. He voices Timmy the Wunderbot in the animated film <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MEAD</a> and will also star opposite John Rhys-Davies and Gary Saderup in Darwin in Malibu, which is a film adaptation of the acclaimed play by Crispin Whittell.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfpcKlsNhmnaunnWLAprXNn5ylnF2jvLg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./server-ugly-truth-restaurants.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Server Reveals the Ugly Truth About Restaurants Full Scoop</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./403015-ekezeni-katika-wake-zenu-watakufaa-wakati-wa-shida-mke-wa-nyachae-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Ekezeni katika wake zenu, watakufaa wakati wa shida - Mke wa Nyachae</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brooke-shields-html.html>Brooke Shields - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-murray-die-in-stranger-things-4.html>Does Murray Die at the End of 'Stranger Things' Season 4?
