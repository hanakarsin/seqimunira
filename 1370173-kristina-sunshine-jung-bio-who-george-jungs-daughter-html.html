Later, she was jailed for substance possession when Kristina was still a little girl. By the time she was going to prison, Mirtha Jung was already divorced from George.</p><p class=align-left>On the other hand, Sunshine's father, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">George Jung</a>, was sentenced to 21 years in jail after being found guilty of smuggling illegal substances.
