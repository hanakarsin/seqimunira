To be forewarned is to be forearmed.</p><p>“When a Nigerian gets into a word fight with you, they are fighting to win…there’s nothing they won’t say. And when they are done with you, they face your parents.”</p><h2>Why I Asked Simi To Sleep With Me Before Collaboration – Brymo</h2><p>Meanwhile, Nigerian musician, Ọlawale Ọloforo, better known as <a href=#>Brymo</a>, has given the reason he requested sex-for-music from his female colleague, Simi.</p><p>Brymo, who recently sparked controversy after revealing that he demanded a sexual relationship from Simi in lieu of a music collaboration, described his action as an “artistic pursuit.”</p><p>This didn’t sit well with Simi’s husband, singer Adekunle Gold, who warned him to “stay away” from his wife and “stop disrespecting” his family.</p><p>However, in a recent interview with TVC, Brymo defended his sexual advances towards the female singer.</p><p>He said, “One day, I was somewhere, and I met Adekunle Gold, I was just like, ‘Oh! Gold.’ The first time I was ever meeting him. And he requested a collaboration… When he came to me, I just said flatly, ‘Oga, I’m not doing any collaboration right now.’</p><p>“Two weeks after, Simi came. I didn’t know they [Simi and Adekunle Gold were together]. I’m sure you all know about Falz. He took the fall that I was supposed to take. I was the target… But I’m a smart guy.</p><p>“When I saw her [Simi], I said no features except I am laying with the woman I am working with, so it can really be intense. Did she not sleep with Adekunle Gold? Is that not why the music is extra good? But she said no, and I was like, okay, bye-bye and then she left.</p><p>“She wasn’t the only one I proposed it to. But guess what? I’ve made music with seven women. I didn’t sleep with anyone of them.<br>“After that incident, I’ve recorded songs with four women. We didn’t even have that [sexual] conversation at all. We just made music. So, it wasn’t about me asking for sex for collaboration. No, no, it wasn’t about that. For me, it was an artistic pursuit.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ye5FsZpqun56xbsLEq5mapF2axaS0wKeenmWnnsGpec2inp6qmZa7tHnIn2Syp6VirrOxjKemrWWVory1tc6nmKWkqWLAtb7Op55mq5mitnA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./314846-how-bigger-buttocks-exercise-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How to get bigger buttocks without exercise: 10 tips that work</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./rob-font-girlfriend.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>UFC Fighter Rob Font and Girlfriend Kathryn Frias Take Their Love to Instagram</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brooke-shields-html.html>Brooke Shields - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-murray-die-in-stranger-things-4.html>Does Murray Die at the End of 'Stranger Things' Season 4?
