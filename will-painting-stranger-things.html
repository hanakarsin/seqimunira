On Friday, May 27, the streaming service released the first seven episodes of the highly-anticipated fourth season of <a href=#>Stranger Things</a>, and things are more mysterious than ever.</p><p>With the horrifying threat known as <a href=#>Vecna</a> on the loose, it's tough for fans to discern what will happen in the end. Does anyone in "The Party" die? Will Eleven (<a href=#>Millie Bobby Brown</a>) get her powers back and save the world? You'll have to tune in to find out!</p><p>For now, let's discuss the biggest mystery that's stumping many fans: Will's painting. What is it? Who is it for? Keep reading for all the known details. Plus, stick around as we discuss a few fan theories!</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Eleven reveals that Will is painting a lot but won't show her what he's working on.</h2><p>It's been nine months since the Battle of Starcourt, and four of the main characters have moved to California to escape the horrors of Hawkins — Joyce (<a href=#>Winona Ryder</a>), Will (<a href=#>Noah Schnapp</a>), Jonathan (<a href=#>Charlie Heaton</a>), and Eleven.</p><p>In their reintroduction, Eleven writes a letter to her boyfriend, Mike (<a href=#>Finn Wolfhard</a>), and updates him on the quartet's new life on the West Coast. After diving into Joyce and Jonathan's lives, she directs her attention to Will.</p><p>Eleven informs Mike that he is painting a lot but refuses to show her what he's working on, suggesting it might be for a girl he likes; however, that doesn't seem to be the case once Will abruptly rejects a girl who tries to play footsie with him in class. Plus, eagle-eyed fans have noticed that Will carries the painting with him everywhere he goes with Mike ... could it be?</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>stranger things spoilers //<br>eleven really just said “will’s painting something but won’t tell me what it is, i think it’s for a girl he likes” NO ONE TELL HER</p>— javi (@lobasreplyguy) <a href=#>May 27, 2022</a></figure><p>Although we have yet to see the actual artwork (hopefully in Vol. 2), there are several theories indicating that he did, in fact, paint the piece for Mike. Now, <a href=#>Will's sexuality</a> has been at the center of several Stranger Things-centric discussions over the years, and, according to viewers, this minor storyline points to Will having feelings for his best friend.</p><p>Let's see what the fans have to say about the possibility of #Byler becoming a reality due to Will's painting.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">'Stranger Things' fans believe Will's painting is for Mike.</h2><p>Since the start of Stranger Things, Will's artwork has played a pivotal role in the overall story by providing major clues to significant events in the series; for example, his art in Season 2 revealed a map of the underground tunnels in Hawkins.</p><p>With this in mind, could Will's painting play a part in stopping Vecna? Possibly, but fans are convinced that it's for Mike.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Mike when he asks what Will is holding and he says ‘it’s just painting I’ve been working on’ <a href=#>#StrangerThings4</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/yCNT720Qw3</a></p>— cool person (@stinker334) <a href=#>May 27, 2022</a></figure><p>"How are y’all BLIND to Will’s pining over Mike??
