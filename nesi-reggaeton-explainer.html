So, who is Nesi? Keep reading while we learn more about this reggaeton artist.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Meet the self-described "trap queen" from Puerto Rico, Nesi.</h2><p>Nesi started freestyling a few years before catching the attention of fellow Puerto Rican Bad Bunny and quickly became someone to look out for in the underground scene.&nbsp;</p><p>"It started off as a hobby," she tells <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Trap House Latino,</a> noting that she was relatively shy when she started freestyling on Facebook, which is where she first caught the attention of some big freestyle pages, notably Freestyle Mania, that helped her increase her following.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>As some of Nesi's videos began to go viral, she attracted a fanbase that became obsessed with both her lyrics and her delivery. Bad Bunny was among one of the viewers who early on took notice of her talent, and invited her to lend her vocals to his YHLQMDLG track.&nbsp;</p><p>After he'd written the whole track to "Yo Perreo Sola," Nesi recalls "the only thing he wanted was my voice."&nbsp;</p><p>"He liked my freestyle, and when I heard his track, I loved it, if I'm being honest," she said in Spanish.&nbsp;While she doesn't have a "featured" credit on the track, Genesis' name does appear on the album's credit.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>The decision not to include her name alongside his has caused a controversy among fans who believe the track would not be as successful as it has become without Nesi's contributions. "It really didn't bother me," she said candidly in a video where she appears genuinely grateful for the doors the opportunity has opened for her.</p><p>For <a href=#>Bad Bunny</a>, the decision came out of the fact that he initially wanted to do the track alone. Having already written the lyrics for the song that "was born in [his] mind," he needed female vocals to help him reach a pitch he couldn't alone.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>por hacerme parte de tu exitoso proyecto y por tus buenas vibras agradecida siempre, respeto. üéØ</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>ùêç ùêû ùê¨ ùê¢</a> (@nesipr) on May 2, 2020 at 8:50pm PDT</p></figure><p>"Nesi's voice can be the voice of any girl," he said in an Instagram Live on the subject. "It's the voice of many people, it's not someone specific."&nbsp;</p><p>For what it's worth, it's extremely common in reggaeton not to give credit to the female vocalists who appear on male artists's songs.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Follow Nesi on Instagram and look out for her upcoming projects.</h2><p>While she might not have appeared as a featuring artist for Bad Bunny's track, Nesi did recently sign on to record label Hear This Music, which previously represented Bad Bunny. And if there was any doubt about it before, it seems now that the two are very fond and full of respect for one another.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>"FROM FREE[STYLE] TO THE AMERICAN BILLBOARDS," Nesi wrote on her Instagram page following the iconic live performance of "Yo Perreo Sola."
