he only reads,” El-Zakzaky said when asked about insinuation Buhari has a score to settle with him.</p><p>The Shiites leader also berated the Minister of Information and Culture, <strong>Lai Mohammed</strong>, for lying that the DSS spent N3.5m monthly to feed him and his wife during their time in detention.</p><p>According to El-Zakzaky, they actually took care of their own feeding the entire five years they spent in detention and prison.</p><p>He said: “The real truth is that all through our detention we fed ourselves. Since the time we reached Kaduna, after we were released, nobody gave us a single bottle of water! We were feeding ourselves. Even during our stay in Abuja, we were feeding ourselves.</p><p>“But this is something that cannot be disclosed because it was illegal. Legally, they were supposed to feed us. But they didn’t want anybody to hear that we were feeding ourselves.</p><p>“For the entire five years, seven months that we were in detention, we fed ourselves; nobody gave us a bottle of water!</p><p>“We were even paying electricity and water bills, while in detention. We were paying also for the fuel to power the generator. We bought our own generator in Abuja, even when we were in detention and we were buying fuel to run it.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH5ze5ByZputmJa%2FqnnCmqWnp6RiwLGxwKRkpZmZYrqwtMCmpJ6cXZ7Abq2MpaCaql2auW7GwKSxmqOpYsCxtculqmasn6V6tLHCq5ytZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./cindy-mello-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Cindy Mello - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./349949-kakamega-mke-amuua-mume-wake-kuhusiana-na-ugali-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kakamega: Mke amuua mume wake kuhusiana na ugali</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brooke-shields-html.html>Brooke Shields - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-murray-die-in-stranger-things-4.html>Does Murray Die at the End of 'Stranger Things' Season 4?
