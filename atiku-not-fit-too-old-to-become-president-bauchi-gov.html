This is because this is the opinion of Bauchi which is the appreciation of what we are doing together. Bauchi can be better if I’m at the center.</p><p>“But certainly, we have to manage the two together (Bauchi and the Presidential campaign). I told my younger brother and my colleague (deputy governor) that he should not be happy to send me forth so that he will take over the governorship, I will do the two together.</p><p>“One of my brothers, a formidable and astute politician, Matawalle Sokoto (Aminu Tambuwal) did it before, so we are going to also test it. And I will not give (the governorship seat) to hold forth, such a big man, he will not give me back when I come back, but if he will give me, I will give it to him.</p><p>“There is no need for us to be greedy; of course, my presidency will not cause division. You can see that at the heat of the time that my elder brother, Malam Adamu was going round, we invited our elder statesman, the one that we respect so much, the Waziri Adamawa (Atiku Abubakar), we named a road after him.</p><p>“We invited him to Bauchi and we interacted and I told him that in this game, I know he’s the most senior, he’s very qualified but because of his age and fatigue that he has suffered so much for Nigeria, he should allow his younger brother to be his spare tyre not to take over just like that. But if Nigerians prefer him, I will support him. I am not too desperate but he should know that Nigerians like me too. And whatever he wants, I will do it for him, so this is our agreement, he has the highest respect from me.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH1ye5JpZpqsmaDCbrrOrWSfoaRiwbC7jKijnWWkpHqjscKopJ5loKeytLXDnqWtZZKWwqS0yGaeqK5f</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./2023-deji-adeyanju-calls-for-obi-kwankwaso-presidential-ticket-against-apc-pdp.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Deji Adeyanju Calls For Obi, Kwankwaso Presidential Ticket Against APC, PDP</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./we-carry-bp-drug-in-our-pockets-during-meetings-with-wike-former-lg-chairman-eke-claims.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>'We Carry BP Drug In Our Pockets During Meetings With Wike' Former LG Chairman, Eke Claims</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brooke-shields-html.html>Brooke Shields - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-murray-die-in-stranger-things-4.html>Does Murray Die at the End of 'Stranger Things' Season 4?
