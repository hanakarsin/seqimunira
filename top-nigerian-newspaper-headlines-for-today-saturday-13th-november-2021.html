This, unfortunately, is not to be as underhand dealings at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport (MMIA), Lagos has brandished the shame of a nation.

Coming in, you don’t want to wait in line for your Covid test, pay this guy. You don’t want to have your bags checked, pay this guy… Oh my God. It is very stressful and draining here.”</p><p>If this were to be an isolated case, Sabbatical will not be taken seriously. There have been numerous reports of shenanigans at the Lagos international airport.
