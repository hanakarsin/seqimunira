But do we know who the song writer is? Here's what went into making it.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: YouTube</span></figure><p>So, <a href=#>Addison Rae</a>'s fist single is here, and ... fans are divided. The <a href=#>TikTok</a> star surprised fans on March 18 when she dropped the single for "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Obsessed</a>," a song about being obsessed with herself. The accompanying video is sultry, involves a dance routine, and has the word "obsessed" splashed across the screen several times in case you forgot which song you were listening to.</p><p>"It's not as deep as people will think it is," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Addison Rae told Rolling Stone</a>.</p><p>Mostly, fans were just wondering why the influencer decided to make music in the first place. "Can y’all quit making random ass people famous who have no future in a music career, i don’t wanna hear anything about addison rae’s song," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one person tweeted</a>. The tweet has 12,500 likes.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>Some are also wondering if Addison Rae actually wrote the song. Judging by the lyrics ("You say you're obsessed with me / So I took a second / And I said 'Me too'") it wouldn't be super surprising if she did. But like most novice pop singers, she had a lot of help.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><span>Source: Addison Rae/YouTube</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who's the song writer for "Obsessed" by Addison Rae?</h2><p>Ryan McMahon and Blake Slatkin co-wrote and produced Addison Rae's single, "Obsessed." Ryan is known for writing Walk the Moon’s “Shut Up and Dance,” while Blake co-wrote and produced 24kGoldn’s breakout chart-topper “Mood.”</p><p>Addison says, “I feel so honored to be able to work with people that really have a love and passion for this, knowing that I have a growing love and passion for this as well. They’ve been very patient and understanding in helping me about every single step.”</p><p>Addison is the first to admit that she has a lot to learn about music, and says she didn't even know musical keys before she started working on her single.</p><p>“[Those] are basic things that people in music, people who have done this their entire lives, know… I’m a little late to the game when it comes to knowing all this information, but I won’t stop learning,” she told Rolling Stone.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>However, just because she's new to the music world, doesn't mean that she's not dedicated:</p>&nbsp;“When something has my name on it, I feel like it’s very important to know exactly what it is and what the message it gives off is. When it comes to the makeup, I’m really involved — [same] when it comes to my own videos and my own content. It’s all a representation of who I am. That’s how I felt when I started with my music… I really wanted to figure it out for myself, but also surround myself with people who are trusted, amazing, and know exactly what they’re doing so I can learn from them.”<p>Addison says she practices by using GarageBand, creating beats herself on her laptop. She claims she has a lot of say in how her music sounds, and is particular about the style.</p><p>“I’ll be like, ‘Okay, can we find this kind of sound? I feel like there needs to be a double here or a triple here or something here," she says.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Does this mean we have an Addison Rae album on the way? Anything is possible. With a Netflix movie, clean beauty brand, successful TikTok and modeling careers under her belt, it's Addison's world and we're just living in it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfpK%2B0sdKsnJ1lkZmxqr%2FOp2SrmZViwLC6xmauq6Gkmr8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./408331-analysis-all-eyes-on-one-kenya-alliance-partners-as-they-strive-to-prove-doubters-wrong-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Analysis: All Eyes on One Kenya Alliance Partners as They Strive to Prove Doubters Wrong</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sarah-carpenter-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Sarah Carpenter - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brooke-shields-html.html>Brooke Shields - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-murray-die-in-stranger-things-4.html>Does Murray Die at the End of 'Stranger Things' Season 4?
