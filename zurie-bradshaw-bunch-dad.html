Because even though <a href=#><u>The Bradshaw Bunch</u></a> only just premiered in September 2020, viewers are already obsessed with his granddaughter, <a href=#><u>Zurie</u></a>, and are trying to find out more about her. Like who her dad is, since he isn't featured on the show with the rest of the family.</p><p>To be fair, though, Terry‚Äôs other grandkid, Zurie‚Äôs little brother Jeb, is also a topic of conversation among viewers. The show came at a time when new TV was wearing thin and people were starting to run out of things to watch, short of more reruns of The Office on Netflix. Now, there‚Äôs another reality TV family to follow and Terry‚Äôs grandchildren are stealing the show.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Who is Zurie's dad on 'The Bradshaw Bunch'?</h2><p>Although the ins and outs of the family members have been explained on the show, there are still questions about Zurie‚Äôs birth father. Unfortunately, it's a topic that her mom, Terry‚Äôs step-daughter Lacey Hester, hasn't been very open about. She has never publicly spoken about who Zurie‚Äôs dad is and, going back all the way to the start of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>her Instagram</u></a>, there is no evidence of someone who might be Zurie‚Äôs birth father.</p><p>But that has never stopped Terry and the rest of the family from bonding with Zurie big time. She is the first grandchild of the Bradshaw family‚Äôs current generation and her relationship with Terry is adorable. On The Bradshaw Bunch, Terry and Zurie are shown sometimes at odds with each other in the cutest way possible, with Zurie rarely impressed by anything the famous former NFL quarterback says.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>If you know this guys then you know the thing he is absolutely best at in life is being a dad.

But Lacey has never said anything about adoption either. Years ago, she shared a meme on her Instagram with a young girl of mixed race talking about how her parents not "matching" doesn't matter.</p><p>That was the most Lacey has said on the topic and, although it‚Äôs unclear who Zurie‚Äôs dad is, her birth mom is Lacey and Lacey‚Äôs husband Noah Hester seems to treat Zurie the same as he treats his son with Lacey. Regardless of who Zurie‚Äôs birth father is, she is easily one of the standout family members of the show.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>üòç @chefnoahhester</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Lacey Hester</a> (@lacey_hester_) on Oct 5, 2019 at 12:52pm PDT</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">The Bradshaw family relations are a bit complicated.</h2><p>It might be because some viewers aren‚Äôt sure about how everyone else is related that they have so many questions about Zurie. The Bradshaw Bunch features Terry and his fourth wife, Tammy Bradshaw.</p><p>Lacey is her daughter from a previous relationship, but Terry treats Lacey like his own. Terry‚Äôs daughters on the show, <a href=#><u>Erin and Rachel Bradshaw</u></a>, are from his third marriage to a now-ex-wife who isn't featured on the show.</p><p>But all of the women are platinum blonde, further adding to the confusion of who is related to whom. At the end of the day, though, it doesn‚Äôt really matter. All that‚Äôs important is that Terry is the TV girl dad we all wish we had in real life and his relationship with his granddaughter is super sweet.</p><p>Watch The Bradshaw Bunch on Thursdays at 9 p.m. ET on E!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfr8KztcRmmauZlKi1osOMm6ynm5hisaKw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./osun-2022-i-remain-pdp-governorship-candidate-ademola-adeleke.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>¬´&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>I Remain PDP Governorship Candidate Ademola Adeleke</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./310730-moses-kuria-flattered-by-railas-character-holding-grudges-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;¬ª</span><p class=pager__title>Moses Kuria flattered by Raila's character of never holding grudges</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brooke-shields-html.html>Brooke Shields - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-murray-die-in-stranger-things-4.html>Does Murray Die at the End of 'Stranger Things' Season 4?
