The 21-year-old Atlanta native is the brains behind the hits "Faygo Dreams" and "Flossing." "Faygo Dream" alone has over 100 million plays on Spotify. 6 Dogs was on his way to stardom, and was beloved by millions. What happened?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">What happened to 6 Dogs?</h2><p>At the time, it's been reported that 6 Dogs died by suicide. However, this has not been officially confirmed by neither family nor his management team. The Twitter account for the podcast No Jumper was one of the first to tweet about the news, saying, "It’s been reported that Atlanta artist #6dogs passed by suicide today. The rapper was just 21. Let’s keep his family and loved ones in our prayers."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>It’s been reported that Atlanta artist <a href=#>#6dogs</a> passed by suicide today.

Without any explanation, the tragedy is that much more shocking and worrisome. Although we want to avoid speculation, 6 Dogs has been pretty open about <a href=# rel=nofollow>his depression</a>, which may or may not have played a role in his suicide. A lot of his music dealt with topics like depression as well as suicide. And while lyrics were pretty straight forward, many felt that this was artistic expression — not a cry for help.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>RIP Chase :’(<br>inspired me in so many ways and helped me grow as an artist and a person<br>❤️🐕🐕🐕🐕🐕🐕 <a href=#>@6dogs</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/oOslIFvjXu</a></p>— Yung Gravy (@yunggravy) <a href=#>January 26, 2021</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Idek what to say. 6dogs is a legend to me.

(@nessly24k) <a href=#>January 26, 2021</a></figure><p>In a 2017 interview with Masked Gorilla, 6 Dogs shared that he started rapping as a way to combat depression: "I was super depressed, you know, I still feel some type of way sometimes but for the most part I'm straight now, but I just needed an outlet. I've always wanted to rap. I remember just sitting in the lifeguard stand, the entire summer, 8 hours a day or longer and just sitting down and I was like ‘this sucks, I want to do something with my life.’”</p><p>At one point in the interview, he even says that if he wasn't able to rap, he'd take his own life. He said, "Literally if I didn’t start recording I was have killed myself by now, not even kidding. It’s insane what a difference it made. It’s just getting everything out there. I had a therapist at one point and that’s nice, being able to tell things to someone, but when you tell things to literally everyone on the internet it’s amazing. It’s like having a million therapists."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>this excerpt is a heartbreaking thing for a 17 year old to say <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/Nlvmrci0z4</a></p>— Masked Gorilla (@MaskedGorilla) <a href=#>January 26, 2021</a></figure><p>Back in November, 6 Dogs posted someone's note about checking in on friends in the music business (which is one of the industries that has been hit especially hard, since it's not possible to perform live).</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=und dir=ltr><a href=#>pic.twitter.com/OLp4AnVLnw</a></p>— 6 dogs (@6dogs) <a href=#>November 16, 2020</a></figure><p>"Keep trying to understand why but I really can’t.
