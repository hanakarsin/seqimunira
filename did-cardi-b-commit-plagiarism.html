Her announcement came after a heated exchange on Twitter in which she denied accusations that she'd stolen lyrics from another artist. At the end of a fairly lengthy battle, Cardi announced she would be taking some time away from the internet.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who was Cardi B feuding with?</h2><p>The feud started after rapper <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dela Wesst</a> accused <a href=#>Cardi</a> of stealing her lyrics on two features, one for Offset's "Clout" and another for Blueface's "Thotiana (Remix)." Dela's accusation came in response to a since-deleted tweet from Cardi in which she said that she didn't want to give Dela any attention. "I don’t like it’s when people try that s--t with a pic of my kid," Cardi wrote.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Then you claim I stole thotiana from you when you put your freestyle one day after WACK ANNOUNCE I’m on the remix of a song I been record it that I WROTE and RECORD IT infront of blue face & Wack <a href=#>https://t.co/oRnz3wXBkF</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/5k0UGT3R7Q</a></p>— iamcardib (@iamcardib) <a href=#>June 30, 2020</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>Dela also accused Cardi of avoiding the question of plagiarism, and things began escalating from there. "First of all you weird a-s b---h u been trying me for hot minute [sic].You really cross the line when u stalkin my fans page and put this s--t on a pic of me & my kid .SO YES THATS I’m bringing my kid," Cardi <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a> in a reply. Cardi also shared video of a computer file that appeared to show that the rapper had finished her verse on "Clout" in January of 2019.&nbsp;</p><p>"I WROTE THIS SONG IN JANUARRYYY ! You show me you did your clout song in January b---h you might have a chance.I rhyme clout with Oscar the grouch b---h is not farfech [sic] it RHYMES!" Cardi continued.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Cardi also defended her work on "Thotiana (Remix)."</h2><p>In a separate tweet, Cardi <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> that the timeline also didn't make sense for her to have plagiarized Dela on "Thotiana (Remix)" either. “Sooooo stop WITH YOUR S--T. Never Hurd [sic] about you b4 you started using my name for tic too. Stop chasing clout and chase a bag and a dentist like I DID SIS!" Cardi added.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>You posted your lyrics on the other post it said February 6 my lyrics are from January 9th ..Goodbye sweety your DISTURB.Clout chase from somebody else.CLOWN now go do a video about THAT! <a href=#>https://t.co/o4WZreMZgs</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/pnCBCYyEWs</a></p>— iamcardib (@iamcardib) <a href=#>June 30, 2020</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Dela said Cardi hadn't proven anything.</h2><p>Dela maintained her plagiarism claims, and said that Cardi was still trying to deflect. “Starting a record in January does not mean you finished that record in January. I clearly wrote this the day before you debuted it the internet [sic]," she wrote on Twitter. "I didn’t hear the section of the song THAT EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT. I am also not hearing by any ‘CLOUTS’&nbsp;in the verse.”</p><p>The fight continued, with Cardi mocking Dela's rebuttal, sharing the video of "Clout" again. "You clearly were LISTENING TO RESPOND & not LISTENING TO COMPREHEND,” Dela replied. “The lyrics from CLOUT are almost IDENTICAL to my lyrics in Thotiana. So, you genuinely proved nothing to me.”&nbsp;</p><p>Cardi ended it with a tweet offering a goodbye to Dela. &nbsp;“You posted your lyrics on the other post it said February 6, my lyrics are from January 9th. Goodbye sweety your DISTURB [sic]. Clout chase from somebody else. CLOWN now go do a video about THAT!” she wrote. Then, Cardi said that the fight had been fun. "I’m getting off the internet for a couple days see ya when I see yaaa," she added.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmbalecKaqZ2hXZd6pLvMpqCtZaChrqi1wKugrKU%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./just-in-plateau-govt-relaxes-curfew-in-jos-bassa-to-pay-medical-bill-of-victims.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Plateau Govt Relaxes Curfew In Jos, Bassa, To Pay Medical Bill Of Victims</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./angeline-appel-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Angeline Appel - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brooke-shields-html.html>Brooke Shields - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-murray-die-in-stranger-things-4.html>Does Murray Die at the End of 'Stranger Things' Season 4?
