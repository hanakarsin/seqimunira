The hacking group encouraged viewers to "swipe up" to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">join a private group on Discord</a>, according to The Blast. Distractify reached out to Demi's publicity team for comment but did not hear back in time of publication.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So, what happened?</h2><p>Like I said, there were apparent <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">nude photos of Demi</a> that leaked to her Snapchat Story last night, The photos included a link to join a private Discord chat room run by "The Chuckling Squad," which would reportedly enable users to see more photos, according to The Daily Beast.</p><p><br>And although it has not been confirmed whether the photos in question were real or not, (because PhotoShop does â€” in fact â€”&nbsp;exist), the leak was highly invasive nonetheless.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>The photos in question included both a mirror and regular selfie. Luckily, Demi and her team noticed the breach of privacy within minutes, and they quickly tackled the situation.</p><p>According to Page Six, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the photos were removed almost immediately</a> &nbsp;from the "Sorry Not Sorry" singer's account. However, like any online content, the photos quickly spread to other online news outlets.</p><p>Apparently, this wasn't the hacker's first rodeo â€”&nbsp;according to Metro UK, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the hackers that allegedly leaked Demi's nudes</a> may have been linked to several other major privacy breaches in the past.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, the group in question was supposedly responsible for seizing the account of Twitter CEO, Jack Dorsey. They are also believed to be linked to the nude photo leak of Chloe Grace Moretz earlier this year in February 2019.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: iStock</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Fans are worried about how this might affect Demi's mental health.</h2><p>Getting hacked can be extremely traumatic, especially if you're also dealing with other issues.</p><p>Last summer, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the singer was hospitalized for an apparent heroine overdose</a>, according to CNN. And although she has since spoken out about her mental health â€” reassuring fans that she's been doing much better â€” fans of the singer are worried that this might affect her well-being in a detrimental manner. See what they're saying, below.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Demi Lovato nearly died a year ago, lost one of her close friends only a few days ago due to addiction struggles and now someone feels the need to hack her snapchat and leak pictures.
