You can literally spend hours on the game. But lots of people also love customizing their avatars with things like different clothes, accessories, and hairstyles.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>But how do you change your hairstyles in Pok√©mon Go? It's a feature that players of the game have been wanting for years. You can change your hairstyles in other Pok√©mon games, and fans feel like this one shouldn't be different. Here's what we know about how to do so.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How do you change hairstyles in 'Pok√©mon Go'?</h2><p>Unfortunately, there's still no way to change your hairstyle in Pok√©mon Go. But you can change almost everything else. To do so, first you have to tap the icon for your avatar in the bottom, left-hand corner of your screen. On the next screen, you'll see three buttons under your current level: Choose Buddy, Journal, and Style. Tap the Style icon to move forward. Here, you can change things like your clothes, hats, poses, and more.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>In the top right-hand corner, you'll see a small face icon. When you tap that, the screen will zoom in on your avatar. Now, you're in the Appearance menu where you can change your hair color, eye color, and skin tone. When you're done, just tap the Choose button to save your selection and continue customizing if you want. If you don't want to save it, just tap the X at the bottom corner of the screen. Luckily, there's no limit to how often you can change things up.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The closest you can get to changing your hairstyle is by wearing different hats and wigs. Unfortunately, most of them cost Pok√©coins, which you have to pay real money for. When you see a hat or a wig you want to buy, the amount of Pok√©coins you have pops up at the top right-hand corner of the screen so you always know what you can afford.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Here's how you can buy Pok√©coins.</h2><p>Most of the hats and wigs in Pok√©mon Go aren't expensive. Many of them are around 100 to 150 Pokecoins each, but if you like to have a lot of options or just don't have enough to buy what you want, you could run out of in-game currency fast. To buy more, you can tap your current amount in that top corner and it will automatically take you to the section of the purchase menu where you can buy them. You can pay as little as $0.99 for 100 Pok√©coins or up to $99.99 for 14,500.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>pokemon go needs more hairstyles especially since they only have one straight hairstyle for either avatar. how are your curly haired players supposed to deal with these boring hairstyles</p>‚Äî Jesse!!! üåà (@iamprikle) <a href=#>March 24, 2019</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>You can get to the same part of the purchase menu by tapping on an item you want to buy in the game. If you don't have enough Pok√©coins, the game will give you the option to buy more. You can also get there from the game's main screen. Tap the Pok√©ball at the bottom center and the middle button will say Shop. Tap that and scroll all the way to the bottom to buy them.
