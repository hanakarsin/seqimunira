He ran to the field and saw at least nine students trembling and jerking on the turf.</p><p>“That was when he raised the alarm and people gathered to help. The boys were immediately rushed to the school clinic, from where they were taken to a hospital in Awka.</p><p>“Six of the nine boys were resuscitated and are currently receiving treatment, but three did not survive. Their parents have been contacted.”</p><p>A resident, identified as Hope Egwu, told journalists that the news of the accident went around the community on Sunday before it was made public, adding that everyone had been held spellbound.</p><p>At the hospital in Awka, parents and sympathisers trooped into the ward where the survivors were receiving treatment.</p><p>A doctor at the hospital, who spoke on conditions of anonymity, said three out of the nine boys were brought into the hospital dead, but six others were revived.</p><p>The Doctor said, “As of now, the parents of two of the dead boys have taken the corpses away, while one is still in the mortuary.</p><p>“It is sad that they were playing on the field barefooted. If they had boots on, the impact of the lightning would probably have been minimised.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH5ye49uZq2gpaOxpr7SraarpV2gtq240maroaqVmnqiusCmmauZXaXCsbXLrGSopl2bvLDAwZqjpWWWnrKtsI4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./52286-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>WARNING: Six trucks burning on Benin-Ore expressway - FRSC</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kate-mara-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kate Mara - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brooke-shields-html.html>Brooke Shields - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-murray-die-in-stranger-things-4.html>Does Murray Die at the End of 'Stranger Things' Season 4?
