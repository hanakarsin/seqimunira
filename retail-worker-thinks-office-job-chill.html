However, the switch may feel even more dramatic if you didn’t like your previous role, and/or the last place you worked was a vastly different environment where you held a position unrelated to the one you now have.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The woman in the story below knows a things or two about <a href=#>changing jobs</a> and having to make a major adjustment. After surviving her customer-facing job, graduating to an office job seemed so tame to her. She could't help but think that her new stressed-out co-workers were getting their feathers in a ruffle over nothing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/media.distractify.com/brand-img/v1T0LujY1/200x200/kelly-corbett-headshot-kelly-corbett-1632841187031.jpg><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">A woman who used to work at McDonald's doesn't understand why her new co-workers at the office are so stressed.</h2><p>The juxtaposition from working a customer-facing job to an office job is apparently very weird, according to a <a href=#>TikTok</a> user named Savannah.</p><p>In a video, she explained how strange it was to switch from a job that was "literally hell on earth" to a "chill a--, cushy a-- office job." She noted how her new co-workers will act all stressed out during the workday after working for an hour.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"And I'm like, 'We were sitting in an air-conditioned room. I didn't talk to a single customer. No one screamed at me. No one threw anything at me. No one spit at me. I'm having a great time. Nothing is wrong,'" Savannah said.</p><p>She further added: "But now I can't tell if I'm like chronically chill and like maybe there are things genuinely wrong at the job, but I don't know what they are because I'm so used to being in hell that anywhere else is just like great."</p><p>Although Savannah didn't verbally share any details about her past and present employment in the video, she wrote in a comment that she previously worked at <a href=#>McDonald's</a> and now works in the special education field, giving users a better vision of her transition.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>That said, her video appeared to resonate with many others. One user wrote in the comments, "Went from being burned out from 30 hours a week at a grocery store to 40-hour office job and being like, 'that was it?'"</p><p>Another user claimed, "I have constant anxiety at my office job because I am both not busy at all and find everything so calm compared to retail."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>A third user wrote, "I went from a terrible retail job where I was abused daily to a chill office job with a loving environment. I was actually afraid of how chill it was."</p><p>Another commenter simply wrote, "I used to work at Arby's, but now I sit at a desk with my blankie and some snacks while I complete Excel spreadsheets."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>However, there were also some folks who claimed that making the switch from an office job to a customer-facing job did wonders for them. One wrote, "I was [the] opposite lol. My office job was a literal hellscape and when I became a bartender my happiness significantly increased."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Another user wrote, "[I know] retail is most [people's] hell but after being a case manager at a nonprofit ... I just chill at my retail job, it's great."</p><p>And one comment read, “Went from office work to working for a hearing device store, you’d think this would be the bad job, it’s the most relaxed job I’ve ever had."</p><p>All in all, the comments on Savannah's video proved that everyone has a different perspective when it comes to customer facing jobs vs. office jobs. Also, that not all offices are seemingly as relaxed as Savannah's may be.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfp7K1rcilZLCnoqCys3nToaCno6NivKeyyJycZqKfl3qktMilow%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./chuck-e-cheeses-shane-dawson.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Shane Dawson's Chuck E.
