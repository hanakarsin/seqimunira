Many residents found it hard to understand how the<a href=#> senator could play politics with such a critical issue</a>, all at their expense. They branded him “a noisemaker who is a stranger in his own county”.</p><p class=align-left>The locals also still blame Murkomen because the Arror and Kimwarer dams, which were to be built in the county, remain a pipe dream.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/173337ed913e5928.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Analysis: Moses Kuria’s Stay in Ruto’s Camp Could Be Cut Short as Spy Tag Sticks</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Rather than fighting for the mega project when a multi-billion shilling scandal rocked it, the senator shockingly joined ranks with Tanga Tanga politicians who were playing <a href=#>politics</a> with the scam, insisting that no money had been lost.</p><p class=align-left>As if not tired of his betrayal episodes, Murkomen is back at it again. He has now thrown his master, Deputy President <a href=#>William Ruto</a>, and the entire Hustler camp under the bus by showing interest in vying for the Elgeyo Marakwet gubernatorial seat.</p><p class=align-left>The move could be easily interpreted to mean the senator doesn’t believe Ruto will win the 2022 presidential election and is thus playing safe to avoid being condemned to the political cold for five years.</p><h2>Proximity to Ruto</h2><p class=align-left>Murkomen, a close ally of the DP, is among the most prominent figures from the Rift Valley.</p><p class=align-left>He has served for two terms as a senator and also served as the Leader of Majority in the National Assembly, a position he unceremoniously lost in May last year for rebelling against the <a href=#>Jubilee Party</a> leadership.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/efc36f5c97d14981.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Senate Committee Adopts Murkomen's Bill Seeking to Quash Degree Requirement for Aspirants</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The senator also sits in Ruto’s “Kitchen Cabinet” and often acts as the DP’s mouthpiece. As a result, many Kenyans fancy him to land a position in the unlikely chance Ruto rose to the top office.</p><p class=align-left>But somehow, a jittery Murkomen has become an embodiment of impatience, showing every intention that he will go for the top county job in a race that has also attracted former Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet.</p><p class=align-left>The move has been liked to Moses Wetang’ula’s decision to vie for the Bungoma senatorial seat in 2017 despite being a co-principal in the National Super Alliance (NASA), whose candidate <a href=#>Raila Odinga</a> eventually lost in the election.</p><p class=align-left>If Murkomen vies for the county job, he will confirm fears that the Ruto camp is not confident of winning next year.

He has also led from the front in politicizing the war on corruption and opposed virtually every government agenda that the head of state has pushed, regardless of how beneficial it was to Kenyans.</p><p class=align-left>While some political pundits have previously explained that the senator lost touch with reality after power got into his head, others have clarified that he is all noise and some politics, with no real strategy.</p><p class=align-left>Political pundit Herman Manyora at one point, noted that Murkomen, though young, educated and energetic, is not effective for Ruto’s ambitions.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/92641e3b67cd36df.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Senator Cleophas Malala Washed in Suit as Friends Celebrate His Birthday</span></p></a><p class=align-left>He stated that the Senator had let Ruto down since, as the figurehead of the DP’s political wing, one would have expected him to take charge and provide strategic thinking, which he has not.</p><p class=align-left>According to Manyora, Murkomen’s demeanour is largely influenced by his desire to succeed Ruto in the Rift Valley.</p><p class=align-left>By seeking to become a governor, the senator is thus going for a low hanging fruit he feels will help him remain relevant in politics, whether Ruto wins the presidency or not. In the likely event that the DP fails to clinch the top job in 2022 and finds himself out of elected leadership, Murkomen could then go for the kill and try to wrestle the leadership of the Rift Valley from the grip of a weakened Ruto.</p><p class=align-left><strong><i>The writer is Milan Kiplagat, a regular commentator on social, economic and political affairs.</i></strong></p><p class=align-left><strong><i>Do you have a groundbreaking story you would like us to publish?
