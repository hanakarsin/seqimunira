She spoke about spending time with her friends and family, leading some to wonder if Tayshia had taken a leave from her job. Now that she's starring on The Bachelorette, viewers are curious: What does Tayshia do for a living?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What does Tayshia do for a living?</h2><p>While most contestants talked about loving a guy's smile, physique, or hair, in Tayshia's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">intro video</a> for the show, she talked about how the first thing she really notices in someone is their veins.</p><p>"I'm a phlebotomist, so I actually love to poke people's veins and draw their blood, so I'm probably looking at your veins when I first meet you," she said. The then 28-year-old California native was dubbed by Chris Harrison as being both beauty and brains.</p><p>When she worked as a phlebotomist, she drew blood from patients for purposes like research, testing, and donations. She got her Bachelor of Science degree in biology medical science from Concordia University in 2012. It seems like Tayshia's focus has been on general health, as she also has worked as a fitness instructor at places like SoulCycle. She's also interested in volunteering, which may have stemmed from the 12 years she spent as a Girl Scout helping others.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Tayshia also seems to have made some money from her Instagram account, as she now promotes several companies on her page. Seems like she can add "influencer" to her Bachelor job description.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Tayshia is no longer a phlebotomist as of 2019.</h2><p>“I’m not practicing phlebotomy anymore. I don’t know if I’ll go back into medicine,” Tayshia told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vulture</a> in 2019. “As much as I love it and went to school for it, my passion has always been in real estate, development, interior design and architecture,” she added. “I think I’m going to gravitate toward that. I’m currently working at an interior design firm, and I hope this blossoms and opens doors for my career. You’ll see me out there. I’m sure you will!”</p><p>That we will — because in a dramatic twist of fate, Tayshia newest gig is starring in The Bachelorette! She replaced Clare Crawley on Season 16 of the ABC series.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"><span>Source: Bachelor Nation/YouTube</span></figure><p>Will Tayshia manage to find love this time around?</p><p>Catch The Bachelorette at 8 p.m. EST on Tuesdays &nbsp;on ABC.
