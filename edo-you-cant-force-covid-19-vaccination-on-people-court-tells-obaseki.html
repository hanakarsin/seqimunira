People who have not yet been vaccinated at all will depend on remote access to these gatherings.”</p><p>“From the second week of September people may not be allowed to worship in churches and mosques without showing proof of their vaccination cards at the gates.”</p><p>“Similarly, people will not be allowed at event centers, receptions or parties, without showing proof of their vaccination cards. People will not be allowed to access banking services from the middle of September 2021, if they are not vaccinated.”</p><p>“We have made adequate arrangements with security agencies to prevent anybody who doesn’t have vaccination cards to access any of these places. We are doing this to protect our citizens and all these measures will remain until the pandemic passes away,” the Governor had declared.</p><p>Obaseki said adequate arrangements have been made with security forces to enforce the order which he added will remain in place until the pandemic is gone.</p><p>Following his declaration, Osaretin had taken the matter to court and urged the court through his lawyer, <strong>Echezona Etiaba</strong> (SAN) to prevail on the Governor to maintain the status quo.</p><p>After hearing the argument, a vacation judge, <strong>Justice Stephen Dalyop Pam</strong> ruled that all parties should maintain the status quo pending the hearing and determination of the motion on notice, for the enforcement of the applicant’s fundamental human rights.</p><p>The court also granted the request to serve the respondents by publishing the court’s processes in a national daily newspaper circulating in Nigeria.</p><p>The case has now been adjourned till September 10 for a hearing of the substantive motion.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH15e5JqZp6cn2LGsMGMnJinrF2bvLOvxGaaqK6ZmXpyhYyvmJybmaOutbXOp2Sopl2lsrC8y55knKelp8FuwMSlo6xln5eutLHKomY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./fg-lists-condition-for-ban-on-twitter-to-be-lifted.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>FG Lists Condition For Ban On Twitter To Be Lifted</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./2023-i-will-only-contest-alongside-amaechi-if-buhari-insists-el-rufai.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>2023: I Will Only Contest Alongside Amaechi If Buhari Insists</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brooke-shields-html.html>Brooke Shields - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-murray-die-in-stranger-things-4.html>Does Murray Die at the End of 'Stranger Things' Season 4?
