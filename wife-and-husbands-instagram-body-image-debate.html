I don't have a flat stomach, I jiggle when I walk, hell if I run up the stairs to fast my body claps (lmao)!!"&nbsp;"But now I see I do have the "perfect" body!! Every roll, every curve and every stretch mark is put on me just perfect to make both of us happy!!! I love my body and I finally see why he does too!!"&nbsp;<p>The post received over 70,000 likes and hundreds of comments, which were largely positive. But many weren't, and Owens shared a screenshot of one such comment that told her to, "stop your delusion, these pics are gross and has already been shared as a meme."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Jazzy (@a_body_positive_jazzy)</a> on Jun 2, 2017 at 1:14pm PDT</p></figure><p>She replied to the comment by saying:</p>"Earlier this morning I got this very negative comment! Starting this journey publicly I knew that I would get some negative comments and I TRIED to prepare myself for the day that they started. But when I saw this comment no lie it hurt! It stabbed me hard, harder then I thought it was going to!"&nbsp;"So I had to take a step back and think to myself .. why would someone be so hateful of another person! Why would they say such rude things. But then I figured it out! People like this hate on others because they are not happy with themselves! This person does not know me! They don't know that I am VERY healthy and WILL live for my kids! They don't know that I eat healthy, hike, go to the gym all the time and can most likely out lift them any day!"&nbsp;"Just because I'm a big girl doesn't mean I'm unhealthy and promoting being unhealthy! I'm simply promoting loving yourself the way you are! Never did I say unhealthy is the way to be. So for others that want to downplay me as a person and what I am trying to accomplish, go ahead leave your negative comment! They will only be used as fuel to my fire of promoting happiness!!"<p>Jazzy told the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">BBC</a>&nbsp;that she's grown accustom to comments like the above, but that she also received thousands of messages of support.</p>"I never thought that it would blow up like it did. When it happened, I was in complete shock. Anxiety through the roof, mixed emotions of happy and scared at the same time."<p>She went on to explain that she made an Instagram page to share her battle with depression and how she learned to love her body.&nbsp;</p>"I hated the way I looked during the depression. But when I started feeling better, I thought I should share that experience and inspire other women that my be going through the same thing to feel the same way."&nbsp;"Even though it scares me to have the whole world see me, it also brings me joy to know that I am not hiding any longer."&nbsp;"This response has motivated me to love myself even more and to try to help other women and men love themselves - no matter what they look like."&nbsp;<p>Her husband, Keenan, says that he's always been supportive of his wife sharing her fitness progress on Instagram:</p>"It felt amazing to see my wife story being shared across the world as inspiration for other young women."&nbsp;<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKyimrultc2gZmtoYWx8cYKOaW9okmGFr5Gzlmiuop6VYq6vsIyhrKyakaOxtHnIp6qtmZenrq55waibsmWZoq6osYydnJuZpJo%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-much-money-does-adele-have.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Adele Is One of the U.K.'s Richest Singers</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./new-zamfara-deputy-gov-nasiha-resigns-from-senate.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>New Zamfara Deputy Gov Nasiha Resigns From Senate</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brooke-shields-html.html>Brooke Shields - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-murray-die-in-stranger-things-4.html>Does Murray Die at the End of 'Stranger Things' Season 4?
