In fact, he has an extensive luxury car collection, including a Rolls Royce, Tesla, and more.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>If you're at all familiar with <a href=#>Jeffree Star,</a> you know he loves to flaunt his wealth. The beauty YouTuber, who has over 17 million subscribers and is the founder of Jeffree Star Cosmetics, has made it clear that he's more than self-sufficient. Between trying out luxury makeup lines and getting ready in a private jet, Jeffree is no stranger to the finer things in life.</p><p>And one thing he always spends a little extra on is his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">car collection</a>. Not only does Jeffree own and show off more than one luxury car, but many of these cars are customized for him, specifically.</p><p>We don't know if he still has all of these, and we're sure that we're missing a few that he hasn't made as public as these ones, but this is just one look inside what cars Jeffree keeps in his garage.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">A Lamborghini Urus Super SUV.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: YouTube</span></figure><p>In November 2018, Jeffree joined the club of the few people who can actually afford a Lamborghini. He shared the process of buying the car on his YouTube channel in a video titled <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"WE GOT A NEW LAMBORGHINI URUS SUV!"</a></p><p>In the video, Jeffree flaunted his new purchase in the best way he knew how: taking it through the Taco Bell drive-thru.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Another Lamborghini (but this time, it's Barbie pink).</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Even though Jeffree got his first Lamborghini less than two years ago, he revealed in an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram post</a> that he got rid of it to get this custom, Barbie pink one instead. It appears that it's the same model as the last — this time, though, it matches his general aesthetic.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">He bought Nathan a Aston Martin Vantage.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: YouTube</span></figure><p>OK, we're going to bet that this car probably isn't still in his garage, since <a href=#>he and Nathan recently split</a>, but it was only six months ago that Jeffree gifted his then-boyfriend his dream car: a neon yellow Aston Martin Vantage. Jeffree shared the moment with his subscribers in a video titled <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"Surprising My Boyfriend With His Dream Car!!"</a> which is still up on his channel.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Rolls Royce Wraith Black Badge Edition (Barbie pink, of course).</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: YouTube</span></figure><p>Jeffree is no stranger to the Rolls Royce — in fact, some of his first videos featuring a luxury car was his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"GETTING READY IN MY ROLLS ROYCE"</a> series, featuring other beauty YouTubers like Nikita Dragun and Manny MUA.&nbsp;</p><p>But now Jeffree's flaunting a new Barbie pink model, and this time, he gave us a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tour</a> of the car instead. Apparently, Nathan gifted Jeffree the customization for their three year anniversary.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Jeffree also owns a Tesla X.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: YouTube</span></figure><p>If David Dobrik driving around in his Tesla made you jealous, Jeffree's will turn you green with envy. Or should we say hot pink. Jeffree gave his custom hot pink Tesla X a test run by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">putting it on autopilot</a> and doing his makeup while it drove. For those who love multitasking, this video is definitely for you.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">And a Barbie custom pink BMW i8.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: YouTube</span></figure><p>At this point, we're pretty sure that most of Jeffree's cars have been customized to be Barbie pink, and his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">BMW</a> is no exception. Again, Jeffree decided to flaunt this car with a tour of its own, sharing the detailing done on it in a video on his channel.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn7KnstGenGarpJa%2Fbq%2FAq2Scp5yhsqTAyKil</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./shontelle-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Shontelle - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./finn-carr-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Finn Carr - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brooke-shields-html.html>Brooke Shields - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-murray-die-in-stranger-things-4.html>Does Murray Die at the End of 'Stranger Things' Season 4?
