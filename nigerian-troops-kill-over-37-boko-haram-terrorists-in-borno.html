Over 50 Boko Haram/ ISWAP fighters were observed to have gathered at the meeting. Having clearly identified the terrorists’ hideout, the Air Component of OPHK immediately dispatched two aircraft to conduct air interdiction on the location.</p><p>“The strikes, which were carried out under cover of darkness, were successful and devastating, as battle damage assessment corroborated by local sources revealed that over 37 Boko Haram/ISWAP terrorists were neutralized, while several of them reportedly suffered varying degrees of injury.</p><p>“In another development, as the aircraft retreated to base after the air interdiction, the combat aircrew located another set of four Gun Trucks about six Kilometres South West of Bama. The aircrew immediately relayed the coordinates of the location of the Gun Trucks to troops of the Land Component at Bama, who promptly engaged the location with Artillery fire bombardment, neutralising the insurgents’ gun trucks.</p><p>“The successful joint operations conducted by both the Air and Land Components, with the support of other security agencies under Operation HADIN KAI has yet again underscored the importance of synergy and cooperation in the fight against terrorism and insurgency.</p><p>“Troops of OPHK remain resolute and unshaken in their effort to bring the insurgents to their knees.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH5ye49qZqehl5q%2Fqq3NZqurp5%2BlwG63yKWjZqemmr9uf5Zmmaijn2K1or7ApmStnaKnvLO10q2qZqGeYq%2Bwvs2oZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./pdp-crisis-ayu-to-resign-after-2023-elections-bot.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>PDP Crisis: Ayu To Resign After 2023 Elections</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-to-watch-married-at-first-sight-australia.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>If You Love 'Married at First Sight Australia' Here's Where to Watch It</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brooke-shields-html.html>Brooke Shields - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-murray-die-in-stranger-things-4.html>Does Murray Die at the End of 'Stranger Things' Season 4?
