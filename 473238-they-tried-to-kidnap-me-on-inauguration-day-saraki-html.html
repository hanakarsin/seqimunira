He&nbsp;revealed that his opponents at the poll had gone as far as to try to abduct him&nbsp;to prevent him from emerging as Senate president.</strong></p><p>The Senate polls on Tuesday, June 9, were highly controversial, with Saraki elected against the wishes of his own ruling party.</p><p>Saraki during an interview with reporters from Vanguard revealed that on that day, when he heard of the abduction plot to keep him away from the National Assembly, he immediately altered his schedule by arriving at the parliament car park at 6am, stayed in his car and then trekked at quarter to 10am into the chamber.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO:&nbsp;Oyegun’s Resignation: What APC Has To Say</strong></p><p>He rejected the idea that he had&nbsp;promised the PDP the deputy position if he was to win, and said that the election of&nbsp;Senator Ike Ekweremadu as his deputy was merely because there weren't any&nbsp;All Progressives Congress (APC), senators in the chamber.</p><p>He also explained that he was well aware that&nbsp;the emergence of Ekweremadu will make things difficult for him, and said<i>“Never in our wildest imagination did we envisage that some senators would not be present on the day of the inauguration.”</i></p><p>Saraki made sure to note that he never received any invitation to attend a meeting at the International Conference Centre (ICC) with President Muhammadu Buhari on the Senate inauguration day. <i>“First of all, as regards the meeting (at ICC), on the morning of the inauguration, I didn’t finish at a meeting until 4:00am of that day and I had got information that efforts would likely be made to make sure that I didn’t get access into the chamber”,</i> he said.</p><p>The Senate President narrated further: “<i>So, as early as 4:00am and 5:00am, I had made contingency plans that I must get into the National Assembly because the plan before was that senators-elect should go to Transcorp Hilton Hotel around 8:00clock and 9:00am to proceed to the National Assembly.</i></p><p><i>“But I was advised that it would not be safe or it would not be secure for me to do that because if some people made sure I didn’t get into the chamber, it would not be possible for me to be nominated, for the nomination to be seconded and for me to accept the nomination.</i></p><p><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Why We Will Oppose Buhari - NLC</p><p><i>“I can tell you today that I was in the National Assembly Complex as early as 6:00 in the morning and I stayed in a car in the car park till quarter to 10:00am. That is the truth. I stayed there and I was there with no communication whatsoever.</i></p><p><i>“So, anybody who said he spoke to me to go to the ICC was not being truthful because I didn’t even know what was going on. All I was monitoring was how people were arriving the complex.</i></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt5ftovlrj9iv.jpeg><p><i>“It was just before 10:00 that I got information that the Clerk to the National Assembly had entered the chamber. So, I got out of the small car I was inside, stretched myself and put on my Babariga because I didn’t have it on before then.</i></p><p><i>“I walked from the car park into the chamber. That was why some of you would have seen that I looked very tired that morning.</i></p><p><i>“Even when I was in the chamber, I didn’t know what had transpired earlier. The only thing I observed was that it appeared that some of our senators were not in the chamber, but because the fact that my colleagues arrived in batches, I had the opinion that they were on the way and, by 10:00am, the programme started.</i></p><p><i>“Before I knew it, my election had come and gone. Even my people were worried; it was only when I got into the chamber that they were relieved.”</i></p><p>He then addressed the&nbsp;emergence of Ekweremadu as the deputy Senate president. Saraki said,<i> “In my own view, and, in the view of some of those who worked closely with me, I worked hard for my election. I had direct contact with every single senator, one on one; weeks leading to the election, I did not rely on anybody. I worked hard; both in our party, the APC and out of it.</i></p><p><i>“I approached every senator, I talked to them, we built confidence, not only in the APC, but, also, in the PDP. I talked to them. That was why I laughed when people said I had a deal with Ekweremadu or I had a hand in the emergence of Ekweremadu.</i></p><p><i>“I didn’t need any deal to win. I had penetrated, there was no deal; I didn’t need any deal in the first place. I had worked hard such that everybody who was a Senator, I campaigned hard and canvassed for their votes and won their confidence.</i></p><p><i>“At one of the meetings held at Transcorp Hilton which Senator Godswill Akpabio co-chaired with Senator Ibrahim Gobir and a few others, which had both APC and PDP members, if you heard most of them there, the position they took was that ‘this is the Senate President they want.’</i></p><p><strong>READ ALSO:</strong>&nbsp;</p><p><i>“Across party lines, that day they believed in me and that this is the Senate President that can lead us, there was no deal.</i></p><p><i>“Sometimes, I wonder how some of our colleagues found themselves at the ICC. If it had been a case that the Clerk of the National Assembly had made an announcement and the event had been postponed or it was no longer holding, plus, the invitation, I’m sure some are asking now, what really happened?</i></p><p><i>“First of all, the PDP senators had announced to the public that they were supporting me without even meeting me because, in their own meeting, majority had decided to vote for me.</i></p><p><i>“In their own interest, strategically, they decided that, `look, this is a fait accompli’ because 30 of their own senators were going to vote for this man anyway and the remaining felt it was better to join.</i></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt9fq4f1uhpk2.jpeg><p><i>“It wasn’t until 2am that they called us to tell us their decision. With regards to the deputy, when they told us that they had a candidate, we, too, told them we had a candidate for deputy Senate president in the person of Senator Ali Ndume!</i></p><p><i>“After our own meeting, it was our thinking that it was after the election of the Senate President that the two groups in APC would meet and we would agree on a candidate. We never in our imagination thought they would not turn up. By the time we got there, we were only 24 while the PDP was more than 40.</i></p><p><strong>READ ALSO:&nbsp;Archbishop Tells APC What To Do For Solving Crisis</strong></p><p><i>“In an election, there’s no way they would not have defeated us and that was what happened? And now, when people say it was a deal, I say that if the CNA had started the procedure in the House of Representatives first, and moved to the Senate, thereafter, today, we, the APC, would have had a deputy Senate President.</i></p><p>Saraki's recent victory at the senate polls&nbsp;was one that the APC hoped not to face as they had handpicked Senator Ahmed Lawan as the party's choice.</p><p>Party elders had been against Saraki's choice from the beginning but the former Kwara state politician outsmarted his own party.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkgXh%2FkWxvZqyYmsZuwNGinJ1lpKR6rLXDp5ipZZ2aerC6jKKlmq2Xqr%2BiwMiopWacka56tK3RmqKiZpipuq0%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./1061414-top-10-dangerous-cults-world-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Top 10 dangerous religious cults in the world</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-boys-spinoff-shows.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Boys Spinoff Show Is Finally Starting Production</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brooke-shields-html.html>Brooke Shields - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-murray-die-in-stranger-things-4.html>Does Murray Die at the End of 'Stranger Things' Season 4?
