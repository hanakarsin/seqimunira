Things aren't looking great between them in the Season 4 premiere.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: HBO</span></figure><p><strong>Spoiler alert: This article contains spoilers for those who aren't caught up with </strong><strong>Succession.</strong></p><p>Most <a href=#>Succession</a> fans might be shipping Greg and <a href=#>Tom</a> as an unofficial endgame “couple,” but Tom and <a href=#>Shiv</a> have been together from the beginning. And after the Season 4 premiere confirmed that they had a trial separation between the end of the third season and now, it begs the question — do Tom and Shiv stay together or get divorced on Succession?</p><p>They’ve been through a lot over the years. However, Tom’s affiliation with Logan, and Shiv in direct opposition of that with her brothers may be enough to finally draw the line between them for good. Tom even asks Logan, in a roundabout way, if he would still retain his job and power at the company if he and Shiv were to divorce.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: HBO</span></figure><p>Gone is the Tom who stood behind his Roy-born wife at all costs. There was a time when Tom would do essentially anything to remain in his wife’s good graces, despite her inability to look out for him as much as she probably should have. This is a new era for him and it seems to mean Tom and Shiv are headed for an end.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Do Tom and Shiv stay together in 'Succession'?</h2><p>By the end of the Season 4 premiere, it looks like Shiv and Tom have called it. They had a trial separation period, during which they continued to see other people, per their pre-separation agreement already. But Tom appears to still want to be with Shiv despite it all. Unfortunately, it does look like an official divorce is headed their way.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: HBO</span></figure><p>In 2021, Matthew Macfadyen, who plays Tom, opened up about Tom and Shiv’s relationship in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NME</a>. He shared that he believes Tom “thinks” he loves Shiv and he alluded to Tom trusting Greg more than his own wife.</p><p>While we see trust play a big role in Season 3, culminating with Tom betraying Shiv for her father, it’s apparent that neither of them can trust each other now.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is Shiv pregnant on 'Succession'?</h2><p>In the third season of Succession, Tom convinces Shiv to agree to try for a baby. At the top of Season 4, as far as viewers know, Shiv isn't pregnant. But if ever there was a way to bring Tom back to her side, it would be ending their divorce talk with the news of a pregnancy. Outside of the show, <a href=#>Sarah Snook</a>, who plays Shiv, is pregnant.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: HBO</span></figure><p>It's not clear if she was pregnant during the filming of Season 4. Or, if she was, how far along in her pregnancy Sarah had been. But if art imitates life in that regard for the final season, it would shake things up in a major way.</p><p>Watch Succession on Sundays at 9 p.m. EST on HBO and HBO Max.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmbxuwM6mZJqmlGLAqbXVZqqtmaliwbCzxK2fnqpdqMKkr8SsqqKnng%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./is-dopesick-based-on-a-book.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Is 'Dopesick' Based on a Book?
