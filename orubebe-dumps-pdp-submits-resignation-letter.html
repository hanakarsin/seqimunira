Against the mood of the nation and in complete disregard for the provisions of the party’s constitution, the party, threw the zoning of the Presidency open, which created a situation that led to the emergence of a Northerner as the party’s Presidential flagbearer, thus making the two topmost positions in the party, after your emergence as the National Chairman, to be occupied by Northerners, contrary to section 7.3(0) of the party’s constitution.</p><p>“I salute and commend the Governor of Rivers State, His Excellency, Nyesom Wike for his efforts and gallantry at the primaries. Posterity will be kind to him when the history of the party is written.</p><p>“There are lots to be said, but out of respect for the party, I leave some stories untold at this time. My belief in the sanctity of Nigeria is unshaken and I will continually work for her progress and development, even if it is through another route”</p><p>The former PDP chieftain, however, did not reveal which party he would be defecting to ahead of the 2023 polls and his future plans in politics.</p><p>Meanwhile, Governor <strong>Nyesom Wike</strong> of Rivers State has <strong><a href=#>met</a></strong> with the presidential candidate of the New Nigerian Peoples Party (NNPP), <strong>Senator Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso</strong>.</p><p>This is coming days after the Rivers governor met with<a href=#><strong> his Ebonyi State counterpart, David Umahi</strong></a> and amidst the speculation that he might dump the PDP ahead of the 2023 general elections.</p><p>Wike has remained mute about his next plans days after losing the Vice Presidential spot to the Governor of Delta State, Ifeanyi Okowa.</p><p>There are claims that Wike might work against the main opposition party after losing the presidential ticket to Atiku Abubakar and also been denied the opportunity to be his running mate in the 2023 presidential election.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH13e5FpZqiqpZeyo7GMnaymqKNivaW8jKysm6WZqcBuvsSsoKCmkam2sLqMpZytrJWnfA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./rachel-campos-duffy-children.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Rachel Campos-Duffy Has a Lot of Children</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./310646-baby-born-in-ibadan-with-quran-in-his-hand-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Ibadan Mother Claims Her Baby Born With Quran In His Hand</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brooke-shields-html.html>Brooke Shields - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-murray-die-in-stranger-things-4.html>Does Murray Die at the End of 'Stranger Things' Season 4?
