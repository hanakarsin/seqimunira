They may in their next meeting, call for the immediate resignation of Prince Uche Secondus in order to save the Party.</p><p>A member of the NWC,&nbsp;who prepared anonymity,&nbsp;said Nigerians are looking up to PDP to save the country and “we cannot fold our hands and allow the selfish interests of one person dash our collective National redemption mission”.</p><p>But in another twist, the PDP National Youth leader, Udeh Okoye, has threatened to dump the party if the&nbsp;PDP&nbsp;National Chairman, Uche Secondus, failed&nbsp;to resign from his position.</p><p>In a statement he issued on Tuesday, Okoye accused Secondus of lacking the capacity to take the party to the next level, describing him as a weak and incompetent leader.</p><p>“He (Secondus) is not willing to take us anywhere, he is just there to make sure he enriches himself. I am here to make it very clear to all Nigerians that if Secondus does not resign, I&nbsp;am going to leave the party and resign for him to eat the party and own the party.</p><p>“The governors, if they don’t wade into this matter right now, if the leaders don’t wade into this matter right now, I assure every Nigerian that within the next three or&nbsp;four&nbsp;days, my letter will be public,” Okoye said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH15e49tZqOto6l6qrqMrJycp56ZwrR5zJqwZqqVqLaouoyaqmaolKV6r8PCZpyxm5yqsaa%2FjKGgpmWWp7yuecKrrJyhkaF6rrHEraCnn18%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./260247-wahubiri-watofautiana-kuhusu-wito-wa-papa-francis-wa-kurekebisha-sala-ya-bwa-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Wahubiri watofautiana kuhusu wito wa Papa Francis wa kurekebisha Sala ya Bwana</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mithzan-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Mithzan - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brooke-shields-html.html>Brooke Shields - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-murray-die-in-stranger-things-4.html>Does Murray Die at the End of 'Stranger Things' Season 4?
