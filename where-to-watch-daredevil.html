It would make sense that, since Marvel produced and owned the rights to these properties, they would only have limited exclusivity agreements with the streaming giant.</p><p>Naturally, a lot of folks would assume that because Disney owns Marvel, the shows would just live on Disney Plus after they depart from Netflix, but is this the case?</p><p>Up to this point, it has seemed as though there wouldn't be any interplay between these Netflix shows and the greater MCU, as pretty much every Avengers-themed movie has stayed away from referencing these characters.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>However, fans were stoked to see Charlie Cox (Daredevil) from the Netflix series appearing in <a href=#>No Way Home</a>, which got people thinking that there may be hope to see other Netflix Marvel Defenders in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.</p><p><a href=#>Hawkeye</a> also brought in Kingpin, which only further fueled rumors that these series would be available on Disney's own streaming service.</p><p>However, there hasn't been an official announcement as to whether or not they would go to Disney Plus.

Although different regions will see the shows exit at different times, it does appear that many users across the U.K. and North America will only have until that date to watch these programs. Looks like we'll just have to wait until March 2022 to see where they end up.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I've confirmed that Daredevil, Jessica Jones, and the rest of the Marvel Defenders series are leaving Netflix at midnight on Feb. 28.
