But what is her net worth? And why does she credit Paramore on "Sour"?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Singer and actress <a href=#>Olivia Rodrigo</a> seems to be everywhere lately. <a href=#>Her album "Sour"</a> was streamed tons of times and fans love her acting. Besides, we're all still waiting for the third season of <a href=#>High School Musical: The Musical: The Series</a>. With all this success, we're all wondering what her net worth is.</p><p>It seems like everything Olivia touches, becomes a hit. And reportedly, she's got a bank account to match. But what is Olivia's net worth? Here's what we know and brace yourselves, it's a lot of money. Like, a lot.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is Olivia Rodrigo's net worth?</h2><p>Even though Olivia is now known for her music, plenty of fans know her from her Disney Channel days. She's starred on the network's show Bizaardvark and then gained fame as a member of the <a href=#>High School Musical: The Musical: The Series</a> cast. All of this and more has given her a net worth of $4 million, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>It's not clear exactly how much Olivia made from her time on the Disney Channel, but if what her co-stars took home is any indication, it's a lot. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ reports</a> that fellow Bizaardvark star Ethan Wacker made $375,000 for the first two seasons of the show. Olivia could have easily made more, considering that she was a main character on the show.</p><p>Olivia may also be making a neat sum by starring in High School Musical: The Musical: The Series. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Career Trend</a>, other Disney stars have made hundreds of thousands of dollars per episode. <a href=#>Miranda Cosgrove</a>, for example, made $180,000 per episode by 2012.</p><p>On top of that, Olivia's album "Sour" is a huge hit. It's gotten millions of streams on a number of music platforms. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Billboard reports</a> her song, "Driver's License," is the first song of 2021 to hit one billion global streams. It spent eight weeks at the top of the Billboard Global 200 and, by the end of March, it had over 54.42 million global on-demand audio and video streams. This means serious money is being sent her way.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Olivia Rodrigo (@oliviarodrigo)</a></p><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Olivia has given writing credits to Hayley Williams and Josh Farro of Paramore.</h2><p>For a while now, people have been noticing the similarities between Olivia's "Good 4 U" track and the 2007 hit song, "Misery Business," by Paramore. Both songs are about losing out on a guy because of someone else and have similar beats. Now, Olivia has addressed this by giving the current lead singer of the band, <a href=#>Hayley Williams</a>, and its former guitarist, <a href=#>Josh Farro</a>, credits on the song.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Variety</a>, a source said that Olivia had been in touch with Hayley and Josh before "Good 4 U" was released and the decision was made because elements of "Misery Business" had been incorporated into Olivia's song. But this isn't the first time Olivia has added credits to a song she's already released. The article says she did the same for <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a> and other co-writers on the song "Déjà Vu."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfpLmqwsiaZKunlKe2qLuMp5ytZaekv7W0</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./daniela-denby-ashe-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Daniela Denby-ashe - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./293381-polisi-baringo-wadaiwa-kumuua-mtaalamu-wa-kushika-nge-wenye-sumu-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Polisi Baringo wadaiwa kumuua mtaalamu wa kushika nge wenye sumu</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brooke-shields-html.html>Brooke Shields - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-murray-die-in-stranger-things-4.html>Does Murray Die at the End of 'Stranger Things' Season 4?
