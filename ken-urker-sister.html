Gypsy and Ken have been known to host TikTok lives at least once per week, and it's clear that he is here to stay. But, because the couple shares so much of their life on social media, followers and social media users in general have seen what Ken Urker's sister looks like. And, um, they have some questions.</p><p>There's no denying a resemblance between Ken's sister and his girlfriend. Ken's sister has long brown hair and bangs, but even if you don't remove the bangs, she almost looks like Gypsy in a wig. She was seen in photos on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gypsy's TikTok account</a>, and she was even featured in a video leading up to the couple's gender reveal for their baby. But who is Ken's sister and has she responded to those who can't stop doing a double take between her and Gypsy?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@kenurker</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Who is Ken Urker's sister?</h2><p>In a video leading up to Gypsy and Ken's gender reveal on TikTok, their family members shared who they each are and whether they thought the baby would be a boy or a girl. And one of the family members, identified as Ken's sister, caused tons of Gypsy's followers to wonder who the heck this woman is and why she looks so much like Gypsy.</p><p>In the video, Ken's sister, whose name is Mary, says, "I'm going to be your brand new aunt, and I'm so excited for your birth. I think you're gonna be a sweet girl." After Ken shared one of the photos that Gypsy posted on TikTok on his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>, a follower commented, "Ken's sister favors Gypsy a lot."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@gypsyblanchard.tiktok href=#>@gypsyblanchard.tiktok</a><p>Everyone guess our baby's gender ‚Äì Boy or Girl?

"They look so similar!"</p><p>Another wrote, " thought she was another sister of Gypsy that no one spoke about or something, not Ken's sister."</p><p>Unfortunately, it doesn't look like Ken's sister Mary is on social media. She isn't tagged in any of Ken's Instagram posts, and she doesn't appear to have a Facebook profile either. But there is no getting around the fact that Ken is dating someone and starting a family with someone who looks so much like his sister that to some, it's a bit eerie.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Mia Blanchard (@mia.blanchard)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Gypsy Rose's sister is her baby's godmother.</h2><p>Even though Ken's sister doesn't seem to be on social media, or just prefers some privacy, Gypsy's sister Mia Blanchard is active on social media. She even shared in a video ahead of the baby shower that she is Gypsy's baby's godmother. And Gypsy revealed on a TikTok live that Mia helped her design the baby's nursery.</p><p>Both Gypsy and Ken are close to their families, and even though there is still a lot of mystery surrounding who Ken is outside of his relationship with Gypsy, the couple has plenty of people rooting for them.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoLKvedSrop6qXai2tMDEqw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./403644-firirinda-mfahamu-mzee-aliyeimba-wimbo-maarufu-kwenye-harusi-ya-rais-kenyatta-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>¬´&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Firirinda: Mfahamu mzee aliyeimba wimbo maarufu kwenye harusi ya Rais Kenyatta</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./tord-larsson-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;¬ª</span><p class=pager__title>Tord Larsson - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brooke-shields-html.html>Brooke Shields - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-murray-die-in-stranger-things-4.html>Does Murray Die at the End of 'Stranger Things' Season 4?
