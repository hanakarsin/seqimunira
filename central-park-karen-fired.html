The Internet dubbed Amy Cooper "Central Park Karen."</p><p>Karen has become the Internet's name for all middle-class women who have been caught doing questionable things, including <a href=#>coughing on other people</a> and <a href=#>refusing to wear a mask</a> while shopping. Media outlets have since identified the woman as Amy Cooper (no relation).</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Oh, when Karens take a walk with their dogs off leash in the famous Bramble in NY‚Äôs Central Park, where it is clearly posted on signs that dogs MUST be leashed at all times, and someone like my brother (an avid birder) politely asks her to put her dog on the leash. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/3YnzuATsDm</a></p>‚Äî Melody Cooper (@melodyMcooper) <a href=#>May 25, 2020</a></figure><p>"I'm gonna tell them there's an African American man threatening my life," Amy Cooper can be heard saying in the video before calling the police. Throughout the video, Christian Cooper makes no threats towards the woman and only asks her to stay away from him as she begins to approach.</p><p>Christian, an avid bird-watcher, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>claimed on Facebook</strong></a> that the incident took place when he explained that dogs need to wear leashes in the Rambles because it is a designated wildlife area.</p><p>Christian claimed that Amy replied that the dog runs are closed, and her pet "needs his exercise."</p><p>"All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off-leash all you want," Christian claims he responded.</p><p>He states that she replied: "It's too dangerous."</p><p>Christian says he responded: "Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it."</p><p>He then claimed that he called the dog towards him with "dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence." He later clarified with CNN that he keeps the treats to encourage dog owners to put their animals on a leash.</p><p>He didn't get a chance to beckon the dog "before Karen scrambled to grab the dog" and yelled: "'DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!'"</p><p>"That's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn," Christian claims.</p><p>Amy Cooper told CNN: "He was running in an open field. This man, he was bird-watching. He came out of the bush."</p><p>In response to Christian Cooper's comments that "I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it," Amy Cooper said: "I didn't know what that meant. When you're alone in a wooded area, that's absolutely terrifying, right?"</p><p>Christian Cooper says that he asked Amy Cooper to put her dog on a leash because they disrupt the birds.</p><p>"That's important to us birders because we know that dogs won't be off leash at all and we can go there to see the ground-dwelling birds," he said. "People spend a lot of money and time planting in those areas as well. Nothing grows in a dog run for a reason."</p><p>After the video went viral, Amy Cooper was placed on administrative leave from her job as head of insurance investment solutions at Franklin Templeton, pending an investigation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>"I sincerely and humbly apologize to everyone, especially to that man, his family," she told <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener"><strong>NBC New York</strong></a>.

I‚Äôve come to realize, especially today, that I think of [the police] as a protection agency, and unfortunately, this has caused me to realize that there are so many people in this country that don‚Äôt have that luxury."</p><p>Christian Cooper told the publication: "We live in an age of Ahmaud Arbery, where black men are gunned down because of assumptions people make about black men, black people, and I'm just not going to participate in that."</p><p>New York Police Department confirmed that no complaints or arrests were made because neither party was present when they responded.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmLKvwNGao2aokae4brfAq5ynZZaev6aw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./english-fa-cup-third-round-fixtures-kick-off-time.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>¬´&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>English FA Cup Third Round Fixtures, Kick-Off Time</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./424278-victoria-rubadiri-leaves-royal-media-services-after-3-years-service-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;¬ª</span><p class=pager__title>Victoria Rubadiri Heads to BBC London for 3-Month Long Komla Dumor Award Training</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brooke-shields-html.html>Brooke Shields - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-murray-die-in-stranger-things-4.html>Does Murray Die at the End of 'Stranger Things' Season 4?
