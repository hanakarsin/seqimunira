I entered the Acting Principal’s office and signed. All of a sudden, the Acting Principal asked me to look at my back and when I turned, we discovered that bandits had surrounded the school premises.</p><p>“We became confused, we didn’t know where to go. Then, the bandits asked us to enter the bush, so we obeyed them because they were many and the pupils, about 700 were following us. So, when we entered the bush, I was lucky to escape alongside many other people.</p><p>“So, I returned to the village and reported what happened to the community. So, immediately our vigilante and personnel of KADVS followed the bandits but the vigilante did not succeed. In fact, the bandits killed one of the vigilante, we just buried him hours ago.</p><p>“It was when we came back from that pursuit that we briefed the Village Head and we started making efforts to know the actual number of pupils and teachers taken away by the bandits.</p><p>“At GSS Kuriga, 187 students are missing. In the primary school, 125 pupils were initially missing, but 25 of them escaped and returned home.”</p><p>Governor Sani, during the visit, promised that no stone would be left unturned in ensuring the kidnapped victims all return home safely within the shortest possible time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH10e49wZq6olJbBpnnNrqSbnaJivKd50q2snZ2eqcBut8idpZqooJqxbq7YZpmappSewbR5yKdkn6qVqLVut8CdrKeZXaiwqbvOpWSarKSWsKx50Z6tnpmcmrFw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./reactions-as-angry-fans-demand-refund-after-kizz-daniel-stood-them-up-for-over-4-hours-at-his-concert.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Reactions As Angry Fans Demand Refund After Kizz Daniel Stood Them Up For Over 4 Hours At His Concer</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./bbnaija-housemate-reveals-he-paid-n3-1million-to-board-private-jet-from-abuja-to-lagos.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>BBNaija Housemate Reveals He Paid N3.1million To Board Private Jet From Abuja To Lagos</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brooke-shields-html.html>Brooke Shields - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-murray-die-in-stranger-things-4.html>Does Murray Die at the End of 'Stranger Things' Season 4?
