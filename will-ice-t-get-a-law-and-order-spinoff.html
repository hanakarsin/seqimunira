We break it down for you.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: NBC</span></figure><p>Since 1999, <a href=#>Law & Order: SVU</a> has been a staple in people's homes. Even if you didn't catch the episodes live on Thursday evenings, plenty of reruns are always airing to suck you into a binge. There have been many a night when we accidentally watched five episodes in a row with zero regrets. Sometimes we still had to get up to go to school in the morning but those were the days, weren't they?</p><p>For as long as <a href=#>Mariska Hargitay</a> has been around (that's 24 seasons in case you were wondering), so has <a href=#>Ice-T</a>. Ice-T joined Law & Order: SVU in the show's second season as Detective Odafin 'Fin' Tutuola, making him the longest-running actor in a television series, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NBC</a>.</p><p>With this achievement, and with Christopher Meloni getting his very own spinoff, Law & Order: Organized Crime, fans are wondering if Ice-T will be getting one as well. Let's find out!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Will Ice-T Get a ‚ÄòLaw & Order‚Äô spinoff?</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: NBC</span></figure><p>Before rumors of a spinoff started circulating, there had been rumors that Ice-T may be leaving the show for years. Basically every time he takes a hiatus to do another project, fans freak out. Recently, signs have, once again, been pointing towards an exit.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>A few weeks ago, a promo for an episode that heavily featured Detective Fin's storyline had fans spooked. The promo in question shows a man pointing a gun directly at Fin, holding a 20-year vendetta.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>üí•ATTENTION üí•<a href=#>@icetsdailygame</a> is now live. Listen to me break down inspirational quotes every weekday on my new podcast Ice-T‚Äôs Daily Game on iHeartRadio, Apple Podcasts or wherever you get your podcasts <a href=#>https://t.co/33xKUwk8Gh</a> (<a href=#>https://t.co/33xKUwk8Gh</a>)‚Ä¶ <a href=#>https://t.co/8q5nbMeC8Q</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/jAyEW2TW7I</a></p>‚Äî ICE T (@FINALLEVEL) <a href=#>February 13, 2023</a></figure><p>That promo, paired with Ice-T tweeting out that he was starting a podcast, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ice-T's Daily Game</a>, convinced fans that he was focusing on other projects. Thankfully for all us, Fin made it out alive on SVU, and Ice-T took to Twitter again to negate the rumors.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>FYI. People think I‚Äôm leaving SVU every time I do something else. Do they not understand I‚Äôve got 20 Jobs! Simultaneously üíé</p>‚Äî ICE T (@FINALLEVEL) <a href=#>August 24, 2022</a></figure><p>Need even more proof that Ice-T is in it for the long haul? He told <a href=#>Distractify</a> exclusively, "I'm trying to stay on the show until they decide it's over... Dick Wolf knows I'm a franchise player. I'm there for the ride.‚Äù</p><p>Ice-T also told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Smashing Interviews</a>, "I made a statement that I‚Äôll be there until Mariska leaves. I think the show is Mariska‚Äôs show. I don‚Äôt think Mariska can be replaced, and fortunately, she‚Äôs still out buying s--t. So as long as she keeps spending money, I think I‚Äôve got a job."</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>So, it looks like we can rest easy that Ice-T is staying. Now as for the spinoff rumors, we aren't too sure where these started, but it doesn't seem far from the realm of possibility since former <a href=#>co-star Chris Meloni</a>, who's best known for playing (and still playing) Detective Elliot Stabler, received his own spinoff with Law & Order: Organized Crime.</p><p>There hasn't been any word if there is a Detective Fin Law & Order spinoff in the works yet, but we definitely would be here for it if there were. And even if there was a spinoff, we're pretty sure that we would still see Ice-T's face on SVU. Again, if we take Chris and his spinoff as precedent, we have already seen <a href=#>multiple crossover episodes</a> between the two shows.</p><p>Make sure to catch new episodes of Law & Order: SVU every Thursday at 9 p.m. EST.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLatuIyimp5lpGK0psCMmmSlmadirq%2BwjKipnZ2iYsCxtc2onZ8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./big-pokey-cause-of-death.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>¬´&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Rapper Big Pokey Passed Away at Just 45 Years Old, Much to the Surprise of Friends and Fans</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./habib-belk-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;¬ª</span><p class=pager__title>Habib Belk - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brooke-shields-html.html>Brooke Shields - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-murray-die-in-stranger-things-4.html>Does Murray Die at the End of 'Stranger Things' Season 4?
