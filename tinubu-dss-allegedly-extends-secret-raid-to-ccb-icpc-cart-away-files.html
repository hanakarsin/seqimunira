and the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission ( ICPC).</p><p><strong>Naija News</strong> recalls that SaharaReporters on Tuesday, June 13 2023 reported that the DSS secretly raided the offices of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) in Abuja and Lagos.</p><p>The DSS operatives during the raid, according to inside sources, carted away files and flash drives containing sensitive information about former governors, ministers and senators under investigation.</p><p>The raid was allegedly conducted at night till daybreak to prevent the public from knowing about it, and EFCC personnel were also instructed not to mention anything concerning the raid to members of the public.</p><p>The raids, according to the source, were more political than made believe.</p><p>The source disclosed at the time that the DSS was working in the interest of someone “very important” to President <a href=# rel=noopener>Bola Tinubu</a>.</p><p>In the latest development, a security source again revealed to SaharaReporters that the secret police has allegedly extended the secret raid to CCB and ICPC, carting away files implicating President Tinubu and some of his close aides.</p><p>The source said on Friday that the cleaning-up exercise had been extended to other anti-corruption bodies – CCB and ICPC.</p><p>“DSS closure of EFCC Lagos office was instigated by Tinubu.</p><p>“The DSS is currently removing all incriminating files from the Code of Conduct Bureau and ICPC relating to Tinubu and his close aides and associates,” the source claimed.</p><p>This platform, however, learnt that Tinubu was arraigned before the Code of Conduct Tribunal in September 2011 for allegedly operating foreign bank accounts, contrary to the constitution.</p><p>He was accused of operating 10 foreign accounts during his tenure as governor between 1999 and 2007 in the charges filed against him by CCB at the tribunal.</p><p>The former Lagos State governor allegedly violated Section 7 of the Code of Conduct Bureau and Tribunal Act, Cap C15 LFN, 2004 as amended.</p><p>By operating the said accounts, an offence punishable under Section 23(2) thereof as incorporated under paragraph 18, part 1, fifth Schedule to the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.</p><p>However, the three-man panel of the tribunal later dismissed the case, saying there was no significant basis to proceed against Tinubu as the charges were “defective and shoddy.”</p><p>The tribunal held that the charges did not disclose a prima facie case and that there was no proof of evidence attached to the charge, noting that the charges failed to show that the accounts were held by the accused person.</p><p>But in March 2016, a senior advocate of Nigeria and the Federal Government prosecuting counsel, Rotimi Jacobs said the CCT was misled to discharge Tinubu when he was arraigned before it in 2011.</p><p>Jacobs said Tinubu was freed in error.</p><p class=postsid
