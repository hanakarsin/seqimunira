style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><h2>Former Vice President, <a href=#>Atiku Abubakar</a> has expressed solidarity with Nigerian workers over their cry of hunger, inflation and other challenges in the country.</h2><p>Atiku asked the workers in the country to change their poor state of living and working conditions by voting out the <strong><a href=#>All Progressives Congres</a></strong> (APC) during the 2023 elections at the federal and state levels.</p><p>The presidential aspirant made this known in a statement issued on Sunday in commemoration of the 2022 International Workers’ Day.</p><p>According to the <a href=#><strong>Peoples Democratic Party</strong></a> (PDP) chieftain, the workers can change the fortunes of the country by electing a leader that would cater for their needs and that of their families.</p><p>The statement read, “Dear Nigerian workers, I will like you to know that I feel your unbearable pains and pang of hunger, hyperinflation, mass unemployment and insecurity challenges you encounter in your daily lives.</p><p>“But I want to assure you that there’s hope from this socio-economic slope if we remain committed to the process to enthrone One People with One Future and One Country for the good of all.</p><p>“Nigerian workers at all levels and all sectors – federal, state, local governments, and private sector – may do well to adopt a new approach to industrial relations and dispute resolution by pursuing labour-friendly policies and positions that will guarantee improved national productivity, better working conditions for workers, particularly low-income staff and casual workers who have suffered so much anguish and pains in their daily working lives and living.”</p><p>Atiku promised that if voted to power in 2023, he will ensure better working conditions and create employment opportunities for jobless Nigerians.</p><p>The former vice president also vowed to solve the food scarcity and inflation in the country, adding that the security challenges in the country would be solved if elected as President in 2023.</p><p>He said: “I wish to let Nigerian workers know that I feel their pains and would do the utmost to better their lots if given an opportunity to lead the country.</p><p>“I am concerned that salaries have remained static, food scarcity and inflation abound everywhere, children are out of school due to no fault of yours, farmers can no longer go to the farm for fear of bandits, traders cannot commute freely without being abducted, no energy to power industries and companies are shutting down geometrically; all conspired as a burden on the citizenry.</p><p>“However, I wish to assure you that all hope is not lost. You need not be forlorn; the time is ripe to vote out bad governance, and Nigerian workers should lead the way with their voter cards at the next polls to ensure the return of better days.”</p><p>The presidential hopeful commended the workers for their resilience and determination despite the myriad of challenges facing them, urging the workers to keep hope alive and continue to be patriotic.</p><p>Atiku also appealed to the federal and state governments to dialogue with the Academic Staff Union of Universities and other striking labour unions to end the current strike action.</p><p>He said: “I praise the resilience and determination of our workers, despite the myriad of man-made challenges confronting them. Nigerians are hardworking and industrious people who can compete with the best in the world given a conducive atmosphere and good work environment: good training, welfare package and enabling laws.</p><p>“I urge Nigerian workers to keep hope alive and cultivate a new spirit of patriotism geared towards nation-building and peace.</p><p>“I appeal to the federal and state governments to work harder to bring the Academic Staff Union of Universities and other striking labour unions back to the negotiation table in the interest of the Nigerian youths and the educational system of the country, which is dying gradually due to these incessant labour unrests.</p><p>“Our country shall fare very well in the coming years if, as a nation and people, our leaders and citizens imbibe a new spirit and approach in our attitude to managing the workplace, corporate governance and our nation’s wealth.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH12e49qZqJllpqyrXnYqKyrZaWjr6at0ZqZpZ1dpa6quoycqbJln5t6qcHNoJyrZZGptqzBjK2cpaSjYruqs8SroJqmXay8s7fEq6po</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-happened-to-mica-miller.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What Happened to Mica Miller?
