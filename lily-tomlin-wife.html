The one-day couple was introduced by way of a mutual friend, and according to Lily, it was love at first sight.</p><p>“A friend brought her to my hotel room, and I tell you, in two minutes, I fell in love with her,” Lily said of her first time meeting Jane. The actress recalled that Jane’s “hot pants, stretchy boots that went up to her knee,” and “little backpack" left her smitten.</p><p>“I don’t know what it was, but I was in love,” Lily said (per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a>).</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@lilytomlinofficial</a><p>Lily Tomlin and Jane Wagner</p></figure><p>The following day, Lily was scheduled to catch a plane from New York to Chicago to do a show. But in a last-minute change of plans, the actress flew back to the Big Apple after she performed.</p><p>“I called Jane immediately, and I said, ‘Look, I don’t have much time, but I have to see you,” she shared. It was then that they had their first date. And it didn’t take long for the two to realize that they were a match made in heaven.</p><p>“It was an ecstatic time when we found each other, aesthetically — and in every other way,” Lily added. They quietly married in 2013, and today, the couple is still going strong and living together in Los Angeles.</p><p>Lily and Jane aren’t only life partners, but they’ve partnered up in their professional lives too. By trade, Jane is a producer, writer, and director.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>John Travolta, Jane Wagner, and Lily Tomlin</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Here’s everything we know about Lily Tomlin’s wife Jane Wagner.</h2><p>Lily’s wife hails from Morristown, Tenn.

Her appreciation of my work meant all the difference to me. I saw her motivation. I saw her drive, and her strength taught me something,” she gushed.</p><p>Catch Lily Tomlin in 80 for Brady in theaters now!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfobatxYytpqakmaN6uLXFng%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jagermeister-cold-brew.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Move Over, Mimosa Jgermeister's Cold Brew Is a New Brunch Staple</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-has-the-most-tiktok-followers.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who Has the Most TikTok Followers?
