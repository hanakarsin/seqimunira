After announcing that she will be shutting down operations, fans are wondering what to expect.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@kimkardashian</a></figure><p>Out with the old and in with the new! <a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a> has made bank off her beauty line <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">KKW Beauty</a> over the years. With offerings that range from highlight and contour kits to eyeshadow palettes to body products, and more, KKW Beauty has quickly become one of the most popular brands to shop. However, with growth comes change, and Kim is ready to switch things up.</p><p>With the news of Kim temporarily shutting down operations of KKW Beauty to rebrand, beauty aficionados are hoping that the new makeover will cater to everyoneâ€™s needs. Since Kim is determined to create a new brand identity, the jury is out on what the new name will be. Here's everything that we know.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@kimkardashian</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Kim Kardashian is ready to leave the name KKW Beauty behind.</h2><p>On Tuesday July 6, 2021, Kim Kardashian shocked fans and beauty lovers with the news that she'd be shutting down KKW Beauty.</p><p>"On August 1, 2021, at midnight, we will be shutting down the KKWBeauty.com site so that we can come back to you under a completely new brand with new formulas that are more modern, innovative, and packaged in an elevated and sustainable new look," she wrote <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">on Twitter</a>.</p><p>She continued, "I'm excited to continue to develop and expand my product range and for you to finally be able to experience it the way that I have always envisioned. In addition, my team is hard at work to improve the customer shopping experience where you will be able to purchase my beauty and cosmetic offerings in all categories from one single website."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Read <a href=#>@KimKardashian</a>â€™s Press Release regarding her <a href=#>@KKWBEAUTY</a> rebrand, here! <a href=#>#KKWBEAUTY</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/9HUDvf10NE</a></p>â€” KKW FORMATION (@KKWFORMATION) <a href=#>July 7, 2021</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>Many believe that the name change has something to do with her ongoing divorce from Kanye West. There's a theory that Kim is possibly dropping her last name. However, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a> reports that Kim will not be dropping her name.</p><p>Other fans have speculated that the rebrand is likely due to rumors of KKW Beauty sales declining.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Social media users claim that KKW Beauty has been problematic due to their lack of shade range and expensive pricing.</h2><p>If youâ€™re hip to the beauty game, then you know that offering a range of shades is the key for success. Hence, Rihannaâ€™s Fenty Beauty continues to be the standard for inclusivity.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@kimkardashian</a></figure><p>However, KKW Beauty has notably missed the mark on many instances that beauty bloggers like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jackie Aina</a> have called out. Like it or not, creating&nbsp;one or two dark shades in a collection that has a plethora of light and medium tones is not acceptable.&nbsp;</p><p>Not to mention, creating dark shades that appear ashy or washed out is a no-no. And thatâ€™s something beauty lovers were upset about since Kim has the resources to provide top-of-the-line products that are brown skin-friendly.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>It literally never gave what it was supposed to give. She must rather focus on skims.

After all, you should be able to receive a substantial amount of product for a high price tag, but people are complaining that the amount of product you get is too small and doesn't justify the price.</p><p>Social media is taking KKW Beautyâ€™s rebrand with a grain of salt, but hopefully, Kim can come back with a brand that truly fulfills the wants and needs of her clientele.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoLi4ecGemK6sqWK7psOMp5imnQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./gbbo-rebs-and-abdul-what-happened.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What Happened to Rebs and Abdul on 'GBBO' During Bread Week?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./404338-julie-gichuru-stylishly-defies-age-trendy-revealing-dress-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>Julie Gichuru stylishly defies age in trendy, revealing dress</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brooke-shields-html.html>Brooke Shields - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-murray-die-in-stranger-things-4.html>Does Murray Die at the End of 'Stranger Things' Season 4?
