After announcing that she had tested positive in December, Ellen has been forthcoming about her symptoms and recently claimed that she has largely recovered.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Ellen DeGeneres provided a health update.</h2><p>A little over a week after announcing her diagnosis, Ellen shared a <a href=#>health update</a> in which she said that she was generally feeling good. "Thank you to all the well wishes out there, I appreciate it very much. I'm feeling 100%, I feel really good," Ellen said from her home. "One thing that they don't tell you is you get, somehow, excruciating back pain. Didn't know that was a symptom, but I talked to some other people — back pain. Who knew? How come?"&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>When she first announced her diagnosis, Ellen said that she was "feeling fine" and assured her followers that anyone who had been in close proximity with her had been tested. She also said that she was following all CDC guidelines and that she would see her fans after the holidays. She also encouraged all of her followers to stay healthy and safe.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Ellen was caught out without a mask after her diagnosis.</h2><p>Only a week after sharing that update on Dec. 16, Ellen was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">caught out shopping</a> and was seen speaking on the phone with her mask down around her chin. The photos caused controversy online because of her positive diagnosis, although The Daily Mail clarified that no one was around Ellen when the photo was taken of her walking around without a mask.&nbsp;</p><p>In a paparazzi video filmed at the same time, Ellen said that she was feeling good, which was why she was out and about. “I feel great,” Ellen said in the video. “It’s different for everybody, and I got very, very lucky. So I’m very, very blessed and very grateful that I was able to get past it."&nbsp;</p><p>One of her reps also said that Ellen had completed her COVID quarantine before leaving the house. &nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Ellen DeGeneres (@theellenshow)</a></p><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Ellen's show has also been delayed because of the virus.</h2><p>Ellen's COVID diagnosis came at the end of a <a href=#>turbulent year</a> for the incredibly famous comic. Ellen was accused of mistreating members of her staff, and of allowing other members of her staff to harass or mistreat their peers. Now, Ellen's show has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">delayed</a> the resumption of filming because of the surge of COVID cases around the country and in California specifically.&nbsp;</p><p>Ellen's diagnosis was only one of the reasons for the delay, and as the new year dawns and vaccines become more available, it's unclear when Ellen and many other shows will resume filming. Other shows that film in California have also pushed back their production as a result of the surge in cases. Shows like This Is Us and Grey's Anatomy have allowed for temporary delays, but they have not postponed filming indefinitely and are unlikely to do so.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmrmtsc1mm56flaOys7HSZp%2BemZyptW7Bz52YrZ0%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./are-nikki-bella-and-artem-still-together.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Nikki Bella and Artem Are in Couples Therapy: &amp;quot;Artem Doesn't Realize His Tone&amp;quot;</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./tinubu-cannot-be-trusted-says-pdp-chieftain-shehu-mahdi.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>'Tinubu Cannot Be Trusted' - Says PDP Chieftain, Shehu Mahdi</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brooke-shields-html.html>Brooke Shields - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-murray-die-in-stranger-things-4.html>Does Murray Die at the End of 'Stranger Things' Season 4?
