One of the most recent new arrivals on the show were <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ashley Ioconetti</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jared Haibon</a>, who first met on Paradise during the show's second season in 2015. Jared and Ashley are often touted as one of Paradise's great success stories, as they got married in 2019 and now have a child together.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why are Jared and Ashley on 'Bachelor in Paradise?'</h2><p>Given the fact that Jared and Ashley are happily married, it was something of a surprise to many fans when they showed up on the beach in paradise together. Thankfully for this season's contestants, they're not looking to win any hearts this time around. Instead, they seem to be there at least in part to advise the couples who are going through the show for the first time.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Past that, their role on the show hasn't been totally fleshed out, but Wells Adams, who now works as the show's bartender and used to be a contestant as well, has said that he's delighted by the public's confusion. "I think everyone's a little confused as to what the hell they're doing there, which I think is hilarious," Wells said in an interview <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Tonight</a>. "I know what happens with them, so I think it's going to be great and funny."</p><p>We do know that their attempt to take full advantage of the Boom Boom room ended in tragedy when Ashley's stomach problems kept them from having sex. Jared set out some roses with the intention of sparking some romance, but by the time Ashley was able to join him, he was already fast asleep.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How did Ashley and Jared originally meet?</h2><p>Ashley and Jared's initial attempts at coupledom were pretty rocky, and their time on season 2 of Bachelor in Paradise did not end with a proposal. The two were together for a time during their season, but when Clare Crawley made a play for Jared, she decided to start dating other guys — and was even in a relationship with Wells for a brief time.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Ashley Iaconetti Haibon (@ashley_iaconetti)</a></p><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Jared and Ashley ultimately reconnected off the air, and they returned in Season 5 to take their relationship to the next level. Jared proposed on the beach where they first met, and they've now been married for three years. When they returned to Paradise for the show's latest season, they relived some of their best moments on the show, and Ashley even got a chance to cry the way she famously did when she was a contestant.</p><p style=text-align:start>“You’re the best thing that ever happened to me,” Jared told her, and she said something similar.</p><p style=text-align:start>“I’m so grateful for what we have,” Ashley said through tears as they talked about their new family.</p><p style=text-align:start>Jared and Ashley aren't in Paradise to find love, but that apparently doesn't mean they won't be regular characters on this season of the show.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecCrnGaZo525psWMmqWdZZqWv6awjKilZpqRmLWmuM6rZKKmXaWus63Doqqe</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./brian-austin-green-health-update.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Brian Austin Green Health Update Actor Talks Being &amp;quot;Proactive&amp;quot; (EXCLUSIVE)</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./1107618-yoruba-hairstyles-names-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>30+ traditional Yoruba hairstyles that are all the rage even now</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brooke-shields-html.html>Brooke Shields - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-murray-die-in-stranger-things-4.html>Does Murray Die at the End of 'Stranger Things' Season 4?
