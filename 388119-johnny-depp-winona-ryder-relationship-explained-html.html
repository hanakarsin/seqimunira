It is not easy to separate true and false statements considering what the internet is flooded with. A look at facts about what transpired will help you establish the truth.</p><h2>Who are Johnny Depp and Winona Ryder?</h2><p class=align-left>John Christopher Depp II is an award-winning American producer, musician, and actor. He is famous for his best selling works such as <i>Sleepy Hollow, The Lone Ranger</i>, and many more. He was born and raised in Florida by Betty Sue and John Christopher Depp, his mother and father, respectively.</p><p class=align-left>Winona Ryder, on the other hand, is an American actress born in Winona, Minnesota. She has been featured in <i>Destination Wedding, A Scanner Darkly</i>, <i>Stranger Things</i>, and many more.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/ec0b422b381d0076.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Candy Jane Tucker: What you may not know about Steve-O's ex-wife</span></p></a><p class=align-left>In the early 90s, these two were the most-envied celebrity pair ever. Their courtship and amazing engagement after five months of being together seemed to point towards a meant-to-be union. However, as things would later unfold, fate had a completely different thing.</p><h2>Winona Ryder Johnny Depp relationship: How did they meet?</h2><p class=align-left>Despite having worked in the business for years, they first met at the 1989 premiere of <i>Great Balls of Fire! </i>in the lobby of New York City’s Ziegfeld Theatre. The two hit it off and would soon find themselves working on the same movie.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/ec0b422b381d0076.jpeg><p class=align-left>A couple of months later, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">they met formally</a> through a mutual friend called Josh Richman, who introduced them. They went to Timothy Leary's house for their first date, and the then-26 years old John fell deeply in love with the 17 year old actress.</p><p class=align-left>According to Winona, she thought that maybe he would be a contemptibly foolish person, but she discovered that he was timid.On the other hand, Johnny admitted that when he met the actress and fell in love, it was absolutely like nothing before. They hung out the whole day and night, and he loved her more than anything in the whole world.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/9b05bf07e7ba18b0.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Shane Maguire and Nicole Curtis: relationship, baby, latest updates</span></p></a><h2>Johnny Depp declared that theirs was love at first sight</h2><p class=align-left>Most people tend to get attracted to their girlfriends and boyfriends at first sight. Things were not different for Johnny and Winona Ryder, as theirs <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">was love at first</a> sight too. Their hearts collectively melted into a pile of goo.</p><p class=align-left>Speaking to the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">People</a>, the actor had nothing but wonderful words to say about his then-girlfriend. He said,</p>There’s been nothing in my 27 years that’s comparable to the feeling I have with Winona… I love her so much. I don’t know what I would do without her. I love that girl. I love her almost more than I love myself.<p class=align-left>This was undoubtedly one of Johnny Depp relationships the actor cherished because he went ahead to a tattoo for it.</p><p class=align-left>Winona described the ex-lover as her first everything. In her own words, she said,</p>When I met Johnny, I was a pure virgin. He changed that. He was my first everything. My first real kiss. My first real boyfriend. My first fiancé.

The pair dated for only five months before they finally engaged.</p><h2>Winona Ryder and Johnny Depp tattoo</h2><p class=align-left>Love is a good thing, they say. Enjoy it as it lasts. It takes immeasurable amounts of love to have a tattoo dedicated to your loved one. Right?</p><p class=align-left>For the Pirates of the Caribean actor, there was no better way of expressing commitment to the love of his life than having a tattoo dedicated to her. However, when they decided to split, Depp tweaked his ink, and instead of getting rid of it, he replaced “Winona Ryder” with “Wino Forever.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/22393eaa54a47bcc.jpeg><p class=align-left>When he was asked about his decision, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">he explained that</a> to have the tattoo removed or erased was to try and say it never happened. He joked that the only thing he could do was alter it somehow to make it funny by, for example, putting her next boyfriend's name on top of it.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/6a0374a176a7e561.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Afton Smith: Brendan Fraser divorce story and latest updates</span></p></a><h2>Why did Johnny Depp and Winona Ryder break up?</h2><p class=align-left>Johnny and Winona were absolutely in love with one another. The pair wore matching outfits, did sport engagement rings and tattoos dedicated to one another, and became deeply in love that they went on to feature in <i>Edward Scissorhands</i> as love interests.</p><p class=align-left>In the movie, they played two characters who were madly in love. However, in real life, the two did not get married. They split due to what Johnny referred to as societal pressures.</p><p class=align-left>Speaking <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">to Los Angeles Times</a>, the award-winning actors said that it was tough to have a personal life after his relationship with Winona went public. He admitted that it was a mistake to be as open as we were.</p><p class=align-left>He further explained that he thought that their honesty would destroy the curiosity monster. Instead, it fed it and gave people license to feel they were part of the relationship.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/ee42afc994523e9b.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Jean Muggli: 5 quick facts about Michael Strahan's ex-wife</span></p></a><h2>The break up completely changed Johnny Depp</h2><p class=align-left>At least for the time the two were together, they read Beat poetry, collected first editions of those poetry books, visited her fathers' counterculture bookstore in Petaluma, listened to music, and spent hours together. Unfortunately, they broke up and called off their planned wedding.</p><p class=align-left>What happened to Johnny Depp and Winona Ryder after the breakup? Depp was left shattered that he could not talk about it. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">According to his close friend</a>, the actor was so desperately in love with Winona that he would not admit it was over for the longest time when they broke up.</p><p class=align-left>Ryder did not breeze through the split either. She became severely depressed and went on a drinking spree while listening to sad songs. According to an article <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">published in the Mirror</a>, sleeping pills were prescribed for her after being diagnosed with anticipatory nostalgia. She had also fallen asleep one night with a cigarette in hand and woke up surrounded in flames.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0bf4342c17f2a948.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How did Flip from Street Outlaws die?

However, in 2017 Amber and Depp divorced.</p><p class=align-left>Amber <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">accused him of abuse</a>, something that several Hollywood celebs stepped forward to stand up for Depp. Winona Ryder was one of these celebrities. The Stranger Things actor declared that the allegations were “impossible to believe” based on her own experiences during her relationship with the actor.</p><p class=align-left>In a statement filed at the US court, she said that she was absolutely shocked, confused, and upset by the allegation and deemed it fit to speak on behalf of her ex-lover. She wrote,</p>He has never been violent or abusive towards anybody I have seen. I truly and honestly only know him as a really good man - an incredibly loving, extremely caring guy who was so very protective of the people he loves and me, and I felt so very, very safe with him.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/8aeed3eb39426e16.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Melyssa Davies: 10 things about James Murray's wife</span></p></a><h2>Johnny Depp and Amber Heard's latest news</h2><p class=align-left>On November 2nd, the actor <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">lost libel action</a> in 'wife beater' case against News Group Newspapers, which publishes The Sun. Johnny took legal action against it and executive editor, Dan Wootton. In 2018, Dan Wootton wrote an article saying Depp had been violent toward his ex-wife, actress Amber Heard, on at least fourteen occasions.</p><p class=align-left>Both Johnny and Amber gave evidence in this case, which drew much public attention and lasted three weeks. According to Depp's legal team, the actor was entitled to very substantial damages considering the harm it had on his reputation.</p><p class=align-left>But on November 2nd, the court said that News Group Newspapers and Wootton had shown that what they published was substantially true. John did not accept the ruling and appeal the decision, with his legal team calling it "as perverse as it is bewildering."</p><p class=align-left>Johnny Depp and Winona Ryder's relationship was one of the best in the history of entertainment.
