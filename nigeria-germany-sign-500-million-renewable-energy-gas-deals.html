Simultaneously, the second agreement brought together Union Bank of Nigeria and DWS Group, marking a collaborative effort in the field of renewable energy.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>David Ige, the CEO of GasInvest, signed the MoU related to gas supply, revealing that the Riverside LNG project aimed to deliver energy from Nigeria to Germany, effectively addressing the challenge of approximately 50 million cubic feet per day of flared gas in Nigeria.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>A statement issued by the Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Ajuri Ngelale, quoted Ige as saying: “The project will supply energy from Nigeria to Germany at 850,000 tonnes per annum, expanding to 1.2 million tonnes per annum.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p>“The first gas will leave Nigeria for Germany in 2026, and there will be further expansion. This will extinguish about 50 million cubic feet per day of flared gas in Nigeria and open alleyways of new and greater exports of gas to Germany.”</p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The German counterparts conveyed their confidence in investing in Nigeria’s gas sector.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Frank Otto, the Chief Operating Officer of Johannes Schuetze Energy Import AG, characterised the partnership as a significant development for the German market.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Chairman of Union Bank, Farouk Gumel, revealed a substantial commitment of $500 million for e-energy projects in Nigeria. He underscored the importance of rural inclusion and the integration of more individuals into the formal economy.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>“We believe this would bring rural inclusion and capture more people into the formal economy. Without inclusion, there is no growth. Thank you, Mr. President,” Gumel said.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>President Bola Tinubu warmly welcomed the new agreements, assuring German businesses that with Nigeria’s stable political landscape, foreign investments in the country were well-protected and secure.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>“Since 1999, we have witnessed changes in democratic governance, with peaceful transfer of power within and between parties. Democracy in Nigeria has proven to be flexible and resilient.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>“Shake off any remnants of the military era syndrome, and we have moved beyond that. Despite challenges faced by other African nations, Nigeria stands firm, and we are your partners,” the President declared.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The President emphasised his commitment to sustaining the reforms and building stronger Nigerian-German relations by outlining some of his administration’s achievements, including his globally acclaimed economic reforms.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>“For those who feared various obstacles, look at me; I come from the private sector, trained by Deloitte. I served as the treasurer in Exxon Mobil.&nbsp;</span></p><p>“Define corporate governance in any way, and I am in it. I governed Lagos for eight consecutive years. Today, I can proudly beat my chest that Lagos State is on the horizon and the fifth-largest economy in Africa, rising from ground zero. This is the track record that led me to the presidency.&nbsp;</p><p>“Nigerians voted for me for reforms, and from day one of my inauguration, I implemented the reforms. My inaugural speech did not disclose what I would do. I removed the fuel subsidy that is a great burden to Nigerians from the moment I stepped into office.&nbsp;</p><p>“The arbitrage regime is gone forever. Now, you can bring your money in and out as you wish. If you encounter any problems, rest assured that I have built one of the most reliable teams Nigeria has seen to address them.&nbsp;</p><p>“I appeal to you to forget the past and focus on building a relationship that removes obstacles, fostering progress and prosperity in Nigerian-German relations.</p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>“You can rely on us; we can rely on you; both of us can chorus Hallelujah at the same time,” the President said.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH5ye5FrZqehl5q%2Fqq2MoJyrpZGjxm6%2FyKClZm1gZXqutculoKimXaeyr7HWmpmlnV2au6a%2BxrJkoJmjYrGmrcusZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./robert-griffin-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Robert Griffin III - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./may31-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>May 31 Birthdays | Famous Birthdays</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brooke-shields-html.html>Brooke Shields - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-murray-die-in-stranger-things-4.html>Does Murray Die at the End of 'Stranger Things' Season 4?
