For some people, cleaning and drying individual pieces of cutlery is the bane of their existence. And then there's cleaning all of the nooks and crannies of toilets. Have countertop appliances? Getting any of the dust/grime/gunk that builds up behind them isn't exactly fun either.</p><p>And if origami isn't your strong suit, then folding clothes, towels, or sheets can also be a huge pain in the butt. But there's one piece of linen that seems to get folks more frustrated than any other linen in their household and it's the dreaded fitted sheet.</p><p>There are throngs of folks who've expressed their disdain in folding the bunched-together-edges of a fitted sheet, so much so that it's easy to want just to give up and wrap them up in a closet or toss away into an upper corner shelf to use at a later time.</p><p>But TikToker Ariana Gardizy (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@arianagardizy</a>) not only learned how to fold a fitted sheet properly but used the demonstration of her knowledge in order to secure herself a full-time position at the end of her internship period.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@arianagardizy href=#>@arianagardizy</a><p>More impressive if you tell them you can do it in &lt;15 seconds <a title=intern href=#>#intern</a> <a title=presentation href=#>#presentation</a> <a title=corporatenurse href=#>#corporatenurse</a></p><a title="♬ Cruel Summer - Taylor Swift" href=#>♬ Cruel Summer - Taylor Swift</a> <span>Source: TikTok | @arianagardizy</span></figure><p>In a viral TikTok that's garnered over 5.8 million views, she's shown rapidly getting to work on folding the fitted bed cloth in a matter of seconds.</p><p>A duo of text overlays describes what viewers are witnessing in the clip: "How to get a job @ the end of ur internships:" she writes, before penning: "Fold a fitted sheet in front of the exec board"</p><p>There were some commenters who seemed confused as to why this would be considered an applicable skill, like one person who wrote: "I’m confused, how is this helpful"</p><p>Another person simply wrote: "You're hired"</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @arianagardizy</span></figure><p>There was another individual who thought that this was a piece of knowledge that everyone possessed and couldn't see why it was pertinent to getting hired for a job: "I don't understand, isn't folding a fitted sheet a basic and easy task that everyone knows how to do?"</p><p>Someone else said: "Tried this at Goldman Sachs, safe to say they were baffled but i got the job."</p><p>While another penned: "Witchcraft"</p><p>So why did this work? Well, again, there are a lot of folks who just have the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">darndest time handling fitted sheets</a>, and there's no <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">shortage of tutorials posted</a> by folks online as to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">best way to ensure that these sheets are folded in a proper manner</a>, with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">some promising similarly speedy results to Ariana's</a>.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @arianagardizy</span></figure><p>Couple that with the fact that it's a pretty memorable flex to perform in front of a group of people: if you're doing this in a job interview, you're not only interjecting a fun variable into the mix that'll help you to stand out from other applicants, but you're also showcasing that you've demonstrated an attention to detail for something that could've just been easily accomplished via bunching it up and tossing into a closet.</p><p>There's really no way for an interviewer to predict the kind of on-the-job performance an applicant is going to have upon securing a position. However, they can gauge someone's personality.</p><p>So it's safe to say that if Ariana managed to take the time to learn a skill that was only for herself and dedicated herself a little bit of excellence in that regard, with a task that a large number of people may not have the patience, wherewithal, or dedication to learn, it shows that she's capable of performing similar tasks, presumably, for whatever projects they throw her way.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @arianagardizy</span></figure><p>Either that or she just pulled off a great parlor trick that helped her to get her foot in the door. What do you think? If you were hiring for a job and saw someone pull this off would you be impressed/intrigued at potentially hiring them? Or would you think it was a silly approach and has no bearing on potential on-the-job capabilities?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfm7ytsMinnmaemanBprCMrJ%2BenaRitaKvymagp6yVp7u0tMip</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./zoe-saldana-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Zoe Saldana - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./what-happened-to-alex-dougherty.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What Happened to Alex Dougherty?
