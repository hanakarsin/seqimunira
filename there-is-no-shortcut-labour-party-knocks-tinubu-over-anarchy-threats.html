We will however be careful not to term the action as sub-judice.</p><p>“Having said that, the Labour Party thinks that the statement was unnecessary since the matter is already before the court, and going ahead to pontificate on it could be construed as interference in the duties and responsibilities of the judiciary.</p><p>“The truth of the matter is that there are no sentiments when it comes to matters of law. The law is the law and once the law has stipulated the manner and how a matter must be carried out, it must follow that pattern.</p><p>“If the law has stated the requirement that a presidential candidate must meet before he can be declared, there is no shortcut to it.</p><p>“Therefore, if the constitution which is the ground norm of the law in Nigeria has stated clearly that you must score at least 25 percent in FCT before the president can be declared, anything short of that can not remedy it.</p><p>“We insist that no amount of threat from the APC on the judges in the tribunal can change the processes and requirements that the law has put in place. It must be followed and that is the position of the Labour Party.</p><p>“Let me assure the APC and their leaders that if there were no absurdity, chaos, and anarchy when they forced their way into power, Nigeria will still witness peace when they are eventually evicted from power.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH14e5BwZq2glaeybrXSZqWoZaOdvLPAwq6rZqSRl7y2voypmKusqWK4r7vCpKpmrJmjwqPBjKitnqpdlruivsKhsGasmKeyosDSaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./1412693-what-happened-to-andy-bassich-from-the-show-life-below-zero-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What happened to Andy Bassich from the show Life Below Zero?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./693925-just-missing-budget-saraki-buhari-meet-behind-closed-doors-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Missing Budget: Saraki, Buhari Meet Behind Closed Doors</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brooke-shields-html.html>Brooke Shields - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-murray-die-in-stranger-things-4.html>Does Murray Die at the End of 'Stranger Things' Season 4?
