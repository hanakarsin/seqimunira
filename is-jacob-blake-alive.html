"We stand with all those who have and continue to demand justice, equity, and accountability for Black lives in our country—lives like those of George Floyd, of Breonna Taylor, Tony Robinson, Dontre Hamilton, Ernest Lacy, and Sylville Smith."</p><p>"And we stand against excessive use of force and immediate escalation when engaging with Black Wisconsinites," he continued. "I have said all along that although we must offer our empathy, equally important is our action. In the coming days, we will demand just that of elected officials in our state who have failed to recognize the racism in our state and our country for far too long."</p><p>A state of emergency was declared in Kenosha, following riots and protesting in the area.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>If you are looking for specific ways to donate your time or money to Black Lives Matter and other antiracist organizations, we have created a&nbsp;</strong><a href=#><strong>list of resources</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;to get you started.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsButsCcpptlkqGurLGMmqOirpU%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./samantha-feher-summer-house.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>'Summer House' Welcomes 25-Year-Old Samantha Feher Into the Mix</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./252335-huenda-jamii-ya-waluhya-ikajitenga-na-kenya-na-kuanza-kujitawala-kama-taifa-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Huenda jamii ya Waluhya ikajitenga na Kenya na kuanza kujitawala kama taifa huru, Tuko.co.ke yakujuz</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brooke-shields-html.html>Brooke Shields - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-murray-die-in-stranger-things-4.html>Does Murray Die at the End of 'Stranger Things' Season 4?
