One TikTok-er showed exactly what goes down whenever someone makes that request.</p><p>User @bigjettyfunny uploaded a video with a text overlay that reads: "When a customer asks for fresh nuggets, just re-drop them.

Then you could add salt yourself.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @bigjettyfunny</span></figure><p>"I was a McDonald's manager on and off for years. Most likely when you asked for fresh fries they either A. had just made a batch or B. We're in a rush. Fries are immediately salted after they come out of the fryer. So many times people who want fresh fries will ask for fries without salt because then the employees have to make a fresh batch and then you can ask for packets of salt at the window. If this doesn't work then you can always go in and order. Most restaurants have the fryers in customer view so you'll be able to see them make the fries."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhforClu82ao52rXay8s7fEq2SfqpWotW661KCenqyj</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-right-do-you-have-to-sit-in-your-bedroom-and-give-me-advice-soludos-son-fires-critics.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What Right Do You Have To Sit In Your Bedroom And Give Me Advice</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./tyson-ritter-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>Tyson Ritter - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brooke-shields-html.html>Brooke Shields - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-murray-die-in-stranger-things-4.html>Does Murray Die at the End of 'Stranger Things' Season 4?
