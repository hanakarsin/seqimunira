It was said that the hotel where the restaurant was situated charged heavily for its delicacies.</p><p>Meanwhile, in a telephone interview with the The Punch, Uche Eze, the state's police command spokesman denied the reports.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO:&nbsp;</strong><a href=#>Anambra Restaurant Shut Down For Serving Human Flesh</a></p><p>He said: “<i>There was nothing like that. I advise you to ignore that report. It’s not true and it did not happen. We don’t have such record. It’s embarrassing</i>.”</p><p>Information about such a restaurant initially appeared on the BBC. It reported that police had discovered such a place in the Anambra state capital.</p><p>The report said: “<i>Residents told police of rumours that the restaurant was cooking human meat for customers.</i> <i>Police then raided the restaurant, where they discovered fresh human heads that were still bleeding. The blood was in the process of being drained into a plastic bag</i>.”</p><p>The information also stated that “<i>in addition to the human meat menu served by the restaurant, authorities discovered automatic weapons, grenades, and cell phones. Ten persons had already been arrested&nbsp; for the crime</i>.”</p><p>Efforts by reporters in Awka to get the whereabouts or name of the restaurant proved abortive.</p><p>The news caused various reactions among Nigerians.</p><p>Peter Obas, a student from Edo State, said: “<i>It </i><i>is a shame at this age and time that Nigerians still engage in tribal dichotomy. What part of the world is devoid of sin? Nigerians have allowed politics to steal their sense of patriotism. Instead of engaging their minds on this that will move our nat</i>.”</p><p>“<i>I sincerely do not believe that the three major tribes Yoruba, Hausa, Igbo are Nigeria because we have never considered ourselves as brothers and sisters, every tribe has evil doers, in a situation like this, no one should condemn a tribe for a crime that was committed by a few. I want someone to prove to me that all Igbos eat human flesh. Only God can make us remain Nigeria where sincere love does not exist</i>,” added Bolarinwa&nbsp;Olusola, safety and health officer at New Doha international airport.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO:&nbsp;</strong><a href=#>2015 Elections: Why Igbos Were Against Yorubas</a></p><p>“<i>Well to be sincere I am not surprise at all. Anambra blood flows in my vein. Despite the fact that I am not living down there at the south east I know exactly what these guys can do on a very good day. This story may be real</i>,” said Kingsley Golden from Lagos.</p><p>On his own part, Ifeanyichukwu Silas, who is self-employed in Kano, stated that evil is everywhere: “<i>This is not time to condemn any tribe because evil is every were , look what is happening in the world about the guy marriage , so all we need now is serious prayer concerning the evil act ,so that we can stop them by the grace of God</i>.”</p><p>“<i>Igbos are human eaters, it's not strange to me. And their god is Money. I thank my God during my school days in Anambra State</i>,” noted Austin Babatunde Ayano from Lagos.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkgXV8lWxsZqifobaksYysp56Zm2Kuo7vUrWShrZ2Wu26yy56qoWWimsC1rdSrmKesXZ67bq3NmqSbqpFjtbW5yw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./goose-goose-duck-platforms.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Here Are the Platforms Where You Can Play 'Goose Goose Duck'</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./frank-sinatra-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Frank Sinatra (Pop Singer) - Trivia, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brooke-shields-html.html>Brooke Shields - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-murray-die-in-stranger-things-4.html>Does Murray Die at the End of 'Stranger Things' Season 4?
