In layman’s term, it means that the economy of the country is in the hands of just a select few - “The Rich”. It is one of the oldest types of economy dating back to the 18th century. It is an economy in which the companies, resources, materials, machineries, production are handled by the rich people who are referred to as the capitalists.</p><p class=align-left>In a way, the government and the entire country in hinged on the success of these capitalists.</p><h2>Features of Capitalism</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/8e7e0fe72d3e5c9b.jpg><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Nature and importance of economics in our life</p><h3>The right to Private Property</h3><p class=align-left>One of the main features of capitalism is the ability to own private property. The owner of the property has the sole right to do what he wishes with it. It can be leased or sold according to the preference of the owner. The property can also be inherited by the heir(s) of the owner without any interference from the government. This right is the first and foremost feature of capitalism.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/23ca8e45f4407608.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What do you know about the main top types of inflation?</span></p></a><h3>Profit Motive</h3><p class=align-left>This is the core of capitalism. In fact the economy starts and ends with this motive. Every economy wants to make profit and this guides whatever decision that is being made.</p><h3>Mechanism of Price</h3><p class=align-left>This is the hidden hand of the market operating in competitive conditions. It allocates scarce resources among competing users by rationing price when demand outstrips supply. Price mechanism determines what the producers make, how much, when and also where they produce.</p><h3>Perfect Competition</h3><p class=align-left>Completion is needed for a free market economy. It allows for different people who, by their individual actions, cannot influence market decision so they come together and establish the basis of marketing. The more the competition, the more the variety of consumers and each producer fights to stay relevant in the market economy.</p><h3>Sovereignty of the Consumer</h3><p class=align-left>The consumer has the upper hand in a free market economy. This means that the entire production lies with the decision of the consumer. It is what the consumer wants or demands for that precipitate the production of goods and services. The consumer is known as the ultimate king.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/8e308330ec13fc5d.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Reasons for underdevelopment in Nigeria and possible solutions</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Due to the above mentioned features, capitalism comes with its own advantages:</p><ul><li>Goods are available at a cheaper price.</li><li>Resources are utilized.</li><li>Production is encouraged in different forms.</li><li>Invention and innovation becomes the key to maintaining audience and growth.</li></ul><p class=align-left>In conclusion, capitalism might not be the best economic system, but it has produce impressive results in majority of countries that practice it.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>History of entrepreneurship in Nigeria</p><p></p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkfnJ%2FlXFpbWVlYrqits6rZJ%2BdkanCs7HSZpqaqJmprq210qZloaydoQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./arden-cho-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Arden Cho - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./where-is-david-dahmer-now.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>We Never Hear About Jeffrey Dahmer's Little Brother Where Is David Dahmer Now?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brooke-shields-html.html>Brooke Shields - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-murray-die-in-stranger-things-4.html>Does Murray Die at the End of 'Stranger Things' Season 4?
