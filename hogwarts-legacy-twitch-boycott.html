Rowling.</p><p>"I call on every streamer to join me in taking a stance against bigotry, hatred, and those who support such views," Nikatine stated in her post, adding, "I call on Twitch to end this harmful relationship with Hogwarts Legacy, and continue to take steps towards providing a safe place for the trans community."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>A statement on Hogwarts Legacy: <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/qt3xnv7Peq</a></p>— Veronica 'Nikatine' Ripley (@NikatinePrime) <a href=#>February 5, 2023</a> <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Avalanche Studios via Twitter</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Some streamers are unable to boycott 'Hogwarts Legacy' effectively due to Twitch being their primary income.</h2><p>Nikatine's disagreement with Twitch's decision to run the ad campaign and refusal to stream has led multiple streamers to follow through with the boycott.
