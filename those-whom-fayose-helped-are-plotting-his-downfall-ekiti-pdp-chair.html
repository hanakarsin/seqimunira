The same Fayose that they are criticising today used his resources to prosecute the election right from the time of the congress to the primary to the real election. The man (Fayose) worked very hard with full determination to win that election.</p><p>“But the people thought that if Bisi Kolawole won the election, it would be an extension of Fayose’s government, forgetting that Fayose had nothing to ask from Kolawole as he had told us.”</p><p>Speaking further,&nbsp; the PDP chieftain insisted that the ‘pull-him down syndrome’ was a major problem in the party.</p><p>He said: “Until the Ekiti PDP desists from the “pull-him down syndrome”, there may not be headway. We cannot be all equal. In a household, we have a father, a mother, and we have seniority. Tell me of a state in Nigeria where we do not have a leader, as far as the PDP is concerned in Ekiti, Fayose is a leader and a two-term governor. Is Tinubu not a leader in Lagos? He was governor of Lagos between 1999 and 2007.</p><p data-amp-original-style="text-align: justify;">“Since that time, he has been producing governors in Lagos State and I have not seen any of the governors who have challenged Tinubu to step aside. I have never seen Osun people tell former Governor Olagunsoye Oyinlola to step aside. Bode George is still doing politics in the PDP in Lagos—why in Ekiti? What is wrong with us that we cannot work together? Those people who are crying foul today are the same people who have benefited immensely under Fayose’s leadership.</p><p data-amp-original-style="text-align: justify;">“The moment another person is developing, they will develop cold feet. It is then that Fayose is no longer good, but when they were benefiting, Fayose was good. When Fayose picked Olusola-Eleka for the governorship, former minister Adedayo Adeyeye was not happy. He left the party. When Kolawole was picked, Olusola-Eleka was no longer happy. That was what I meant when I said unless Ekiti PDP desists from the ‘if it is not me, it must not be another person syndrome.</p><p data-amp-original-style="text-align: justify;">“The moment they are benefiting, Fayose is good. The moment it is not their turn, Fayose is no longer good. I have never seen Fayose struggle for another position with anybody since he left office. He has always demonstrated the leadership style of a righteous and determined leader.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH15e5ByZq2gn6iybsPHqKRmnpGuvLSxjKGcpaiVmXqivsRmp6WnpKm2r7OMoaCsZZSkxK%2BywKWjZp2bnsGqec%2Bdp2abmJa2s3s%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./321719-tv-anchor-hussein-mohamed-host-final-show-10-stint-citizen-tv-ends-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>TV anchor Hussein Mohamed to host final show as 10-year stint at Citizen TV ends</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./james-shields-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>James Shields - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brooke-shields-html.html>Brooke Shields - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-murray-die-in-stranger-things-4.html>Does Murray Die at the End of 'Stranger Things' Season 4?
