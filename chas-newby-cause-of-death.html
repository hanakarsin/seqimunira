Interestingly, he was also the first left-handed bass guitarist in The Beatles.RIP Chas Newby thoughts and well wishes from everybody at The Cavern Club."</p><p>Currently, Chas' cause of death is unknown to the public.</p><p>Before briefly joining The Beatles, Chas played with John Lennon in the band The Quarrymen. He then played early Beatles shows after Stuart Sutcliffe pursued a career as a painter. Pete Best, an early Beatles drummer, was the one to suggest Chas to the band; the pair had attended school together since the age of 11.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Absolutely gutted to learn from Roag Best that Chas Newby, the Beatles' first left handed bass player, and friend of the Best family for nearly 70 years has passed away. A lovely man, always generous with his time.

In 1961, he attended college, and later became a high school math teacher.</p><p>In 2012, Chas told <a href=# style=text-align:start rel="noopener noreferrer">Birmingham Mail</a>, "Music was never going to be a living for me. All of us at that time were thinking what we were going to do with our lives, some doing teaching, or science, or whatever. I wanted to do chemistry. John, Paul and George, they just wanted to be musicians."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Sad to hear of the passing of Chas Newby, a Beatle for two weeks in 1960.<br>‘People sometimes don’t believe me when I say I’ve no regrets, but I really haven’t. I have enjoyed my life immensely. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/oszVxK2cEg</a></p>— Beatles Books Podcast (@BooksBeatles) <a href=#>May 23, 2023</a></figure><p>Fans have responded to news of Chas' death with an outpouring of love and support. Beatles historian Mark Lewishon wrote a lengthy <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">post on Twitter</a> dedicated to the bassist, saying, "RIP Chas Newby, fill-in Beatle and fair chap. He deputised for Stuart on a few dates when the Beatles returned from Hamburg the first time, end-1960, including the momentous Litherland date. Latterly he’s been one of the Quarry Men too. A charming man, always a pleasure to meet."</p><p>Not much is known about Chas' family, although he told Birmingham Mail in 2012 that he had four grandchildren. Fans and well-wishers are thinking of Chas' family at this time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmLWiv4ynnLCaqWKwosHSnmSonl2ZsqLAxw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./breaking-bamise-brt-driver-to-be-arraigned-today.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>BRT Driver To Be Arraigned Today</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./top-10-weakest-currencies-in-the-world.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Top 10 Weakest Currencies In The World</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brooke-shields-html.html>Brooke Shields - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-murray-die-in-stranger-things-4.html>Does Murray Die at the End of 'Stranger Things' Season 4?
