You pay a ton of money for living conditions that are sometimes tantamount to military bunkers. Some of them make it impossible to cook up any type of hot food outside of a microwave, and certain dorm programs force first years to share their individual bedrooms with another student they've just met.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>And while each school comes with its own dorm-room norms, there does seem to be one object that's common among them all: rocking chairs. Why do so many <a href=#>colleges</a> have them?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why do all college dorms have rocking chairs?</h2><p>OK, while an official survey hasn't been conducted to verify that every single dorm room contains these specific types of rocking chairs, ask anyone who's ever spent time in a dorm in college and they will definitely remember this extremely distinct piece of furniture.</p><p>Technically it's not a rocking chair. It's officially called a "two-position chair." Guess why?</p><p>That's right. It's called a "two-position chair" because it is capable of seating individuals in two different positions.</p><p>There are tons of different theories as to why dorms implement the use of these chairs, but this one <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Quora</a> user, Jennifer Hu, probably offered up the most comprehensive argument as to why they're so commonly found in dorm rooms.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>From a pure economics standpoint, the two-position chairs satisfy a litany of different furniture solutions for college dorms. They're sturdy, affordable, relatively cheap to produce, and easy to move.</p><p>Jennifer even compared them to other relatively low-cost options and created a handy-dandy chart.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>She went on to explain, "I get the feeling that they're so popular because they're well-built for their purpose and well-publicized by furniture companies that also sell dorm desks, dressers, and beds."</p><p>But there's also a deeper reason as to why two-position chairs are so popular in university dorm rooms and it's got to do with the relationship between <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">seating ergonomics and learning</a>.</p><p>It's believed that the ability to move around and shift one's position while working <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">is ultimately a more effective studying method</a>. There are also tons of people who like to tilt their chairs backward while they're studying, so instead of doing so on a chair that isn't designed for that kind of movement, why not do so on a two-position chair?</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Tons of Redditors have discussed the "college dorm rocking chair" phenomenon.</h2><p>Even a quick search on social media will show folks from all over the country in different schools talking about the two-position rocking chairs that were a constant during their academic journeys.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>does anyone else have the stupid anti suicide rocking chair in their dorm room or is it just my college?</p>‚Äî charlotteü•Ä 9+10 (@charatIantic) <a href=#>August 28, 2021</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Some people recounted the "near-death" experiences they had sitting on the chairs for the first time, while others low-key miss the pieces of furniture.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>oh your dorm bed is too tall to get onto? use a rocking chair as a step stool and put your fate in the hands of god like the rest of us <a href=#>#collegelife</a></p>‚Äî diary of a college student (@fridgequotez) <a href=#>September 6, 2021</a></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>apparently all college dorm chairs have that little rocking chair design bc we‚Äôre stupid and they don‚Äôt wanna get sued if we lean back and bust our heads open</p>‚Äî kel!‚Å∑ üëÖ (ia) (@jungflowers_) <a href=#>September 8, 2021</a></figure><p>If you want to relive your dorm days and outfit your place with one of these bad boys, there are plenty of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">two-position chairs for sale</a> with that classic wood finish.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOoZJqknGKwsLjLnp6eZZSkv66%2FjKGYr51dp7ykt8innmabmJa2s78%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./fardereen-deonta-grier.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>¬´&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Young Thug's Nephew Arrested for Murder</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./what-is-the-mothman-on-riverdale.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;¬ª</span><p class=pager__title>What Is the Mothman on Riverdale?
