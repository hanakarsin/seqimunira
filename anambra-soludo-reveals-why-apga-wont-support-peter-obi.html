It is the third largest, considering the number of political offices it has won. APGA has a state governor, members of the national assembly, and members of the state assemblies.</p><p>“The vision of APGA for the 2023 general election is to expand its reach and spheres of influence. APGA does not consider the wave of the OBIdient Movement as a threat towards achieving its set goals in 2023.</p><p>“The Labour Party (LP) and the OBIdient Movement are offshoots of the PDP. Therefore, they pose a big threat to PDP – not APGA.</p><p>“We wish Peter Obi good luck, but no matter how much we wish him, everyone is aware that we also have our own Peter Umeadi, running for president under APGA. Even if APGA should adopt Obi as its presidential candidate, our votes alone cannot make president.</p><p>“What we actually want to send as message is that as APGA people, and as Igbo people, we want to prove that one who is rejected does not reject himself. We have seen that politically, the Southeast and Igbo people have been denied what ought to be ours by the major parties, especially the PDP founded by an Igbo man, Alex Ekwueme.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ye5BpZpqmkaKvs62MrKalrZSkerOx1Z6YpatdrLW6ecCpnpplp6S7tXnSrqepp6KperGx056pZqeSnnw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./emilia-contreras-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ana Emilia - Edad, Familia, Biografa</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./387425-meet-the-first-muslim-female-pilot-in-kano-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Meet The First Muslim Female Pilot In Kano</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brooke-shields-html.html>Brooke Shields - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-murray-die-in-stranger-things-4.html>Does Murray Die at the End of 'Stranger Things' Season 4?
