The drama between <a href=#>Alexis Bellino</a>, who is technically only a friend of the housewives, and <a href=#>Shannon Storms Beador</a> continues to be as perplexing as it is annoying, even <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">drawing comparisons</a> to an early '90s thriller movie. There is also a new housewife who has joined the cast this season: <a href=#>Katie Ginella</a>, who is no stranger to the housewives world.</p><p>Katie is currently <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">happily married</a> to sports journalist <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Matt Ginella</a>, with whom she shares one child, Bandon Ginella. She also has three older children from her prior marriage to Andrew Sundseth. She shares daughter Kalii and sons Gavin and Maxon with her ex-husband, and based on what's been seen on the show, her sons Gavin and Maxon primarily live with their father, while Kalii stays with her mother and Matt. Katie and Andrew have had to face several issues in terms <a href=#>of co-parenting</a> their kids.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram @asundseth</span><p>Andrew Sundseth and wife Olivia (holding their daughter) with his sons from his marriage to Katie</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Who is 'Real Housewives of Orange County' star Katie Ginella's first husband, Andrew Sundseth?</h2><p>According to his LinkedIn page, Andrew works as a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">project manager</a> for a construction company. He also appears to be remarried with a young daughter. His Instagram page is full of pictures of his family, with his sons Gavin and Maxon also seen a lot on his profile. RHOC lightly touched on the fact that the boys live with their father without going into much detail. Everyone seems to be leading happy lives, but as always, there are caveats and things <a href=#>behind the scenes</a> that make situations murky.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Andrew Sundseth (@asundseth)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Katie and Andrew's difficult marriage leaked into their issues with co-parenting their three kids, Kalii, Gavin and Maxon.</h2><p>While not much is directly known about their marriage and what ultimately led to the demise of their marriage, there have been custody issues between Katie and Andrew. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">legal documents</a> from a 2018 case filed by Katie, Andrew was endangering his children while also breaking portions of their <a href=#>custody agreement</a> that included not making disparaging comments about the other parent. The suit also purports that he fed their son food with peanuts to see if he was really allergic to them.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram @katie.ginella</span><p>Kalii, Maxon, Katie Ginella, Gavin, and Matt Ginella holding Bandon</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Matt Ginella was excited to step in as a stepfather for Katie's children prior to the birth of their son, Bandon.</h2><p>While the custody situation remains somewhat murky, Matt's love <a href=#>for his family</a> is very clear. He penned an article for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Firepit Collective</a>, which talked about the time that he competed with Kalii in a father-daughter golf competition. In the piece, aptly titled "Becoming 'Dad,'" he goes into detail about the relationship he's developed with her over the years. He even shares how he asked Kalii for permission to marry her mother and that they've grown close enough for Kalii to take his last name Ginella.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoK61tcRmnqKmlaG5onnFoqmsrF2dwrSuwKebZqqYpLA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./1106070-disregard-information-buharis-death-presidency-tells-nigerians-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Disregard information about Buhari's death - Presidency tells Nigerians</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./forex-crisis-binance-responds-to-unusual-currency-fluctuations.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Binance Responds To Unusual Currency Fluctuations</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brooke-shields-html.html>Brooke Shields - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-murray-die-in-stranger-things-4.html>Does Murray Die at the End of 'Stranger Things' Season 4?
