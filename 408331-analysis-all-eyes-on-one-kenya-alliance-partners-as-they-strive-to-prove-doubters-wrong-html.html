the presidency on a United Democratic Alliance (UDA) ticket.</p>“We stand here to tell Kenyans that if you thought there was no alternative, please start putting it in your mind that there is an

persists, however, is whether the alliance will stand the test of time and romp to the <a href=#>State House</a> or it will go the way of other previous similar formations that emerged on the scene with a lot of promise only to die even before the Election Day.</p><p class=align-left>There was, for instance, the G7 Alliance that brought together political parties such as The National Alliance of President Kenyatta, Eugene Wamalwa’s New Ford- Kenya, Kalonzo’s Wiper, Alliance Party of Kenya of <a href=#>Kiraitu Murungi</a>, and Raphael Tuju’s Party of Action.</p><p class=align-left>They aimed to form a giant political party, Alliance National Coalition (ANC), which they intended to use to vie for power in the 2013 General Election.</p><p class=align-left>However, the envisaged party never saw the light of day as political realignments saw Kenyatta join forces with United <a href=#>Republican Party</a> (URP)’s William Ruto to form Jubilee Alliance.</p><a

join ANC and at one time was presented as a compromise candidate and even signed a pact with Uhuru, who like Ruto was facing charges at the International Criminal Court (ICC), but which he quickly abandoned, in the end, went solo and emerged third in the contest.</p><p class=align-left>Before then, we have the Kikuyu, Kamba, Kalenjin (KKK) Alliance that had onboard Uhuru, Kalonzo, and Ruto but which also was abandoned as soon as it was formed.</p><p class=align-left>So, what guarantee is there that the One Kenya Alliance is not equally standing on quicksand and would not be swept away by
